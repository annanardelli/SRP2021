Specific outcomes of instruction:
By the end of the course, the students will
* Be familiar with the basics of computer system organization and its relationship to fundamental logic components. 
* Be able to perform basic arithmetic operations with signed integers represented in binary. 
* Be able to analyze and design combinational systems using standard gates, minimization methods (such as Kmaps), and combinational modules (such as multiplexers and decoders). 
* Be able to analyze and design simple sequential systems. 
* Be able to explain hierarchical memory organization and how each level of memory contributes to system performance. 
* Be able to write assembly language program.

Relationship of course to student outcomes listed in outcome criterion:

* Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline.
