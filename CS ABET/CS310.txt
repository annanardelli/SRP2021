Course Number and Name: CS 310 Advanced Object-Oriented Programming and Design
Credits: 3 
Contact Hours: 3
Instructor: Dr. Ling Zheng
Textbooks: 
Y. Daniel Liang, Introduction to Programming with C++, 3rd Edition, Pearson, 2014.

Catalog Description: 
Object-oriented programming and design, using a language different from that used on CS 176. Use of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and libraries. Topics will include flexible system design for such requirements as globalization. This is a writing-intensive course. 
Prerequisite:	
CS-205 passed with a grade of C or higher and EN-101 and EN-102 or with permission of instructor.
Course Type: Required course.
Course Goals:
After completing this course, students will be able to:
* Understand, write, and maintain programs in a second object-oriented programming language
* Partition moderate-sized problems into cooperating classes 
* Implement designs using user-defined and library classes
* Document both designs and implementations in a clear fashion
* Demonstrate an ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.
Outcomes:
* Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
* Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts
