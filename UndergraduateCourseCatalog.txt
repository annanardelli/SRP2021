Responsibility and Policies of the University

The Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 provide that no otherwise qualiﬁed individual with a
disability (student/employee/applicant) shall, by reason of the disability,
be excluded from participation in, be denied the beneﬁt of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving
federal ﬁnancial assistance. An otherwise qualiﬁed individual with
respect to post secondary education is one who meets the essential
academic requirements and, with respect to employment, is one who with
reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the
job in question. Monmouth University has complied with these principles
and intends to continue its compliance. Anyone having a complaint
or observation about a possible discriminatory act or practice should
contact the Ofﬁce of Equity and Diversity at (732) 571-7577.

Human Relations Philosophy and Policy
Statement
Monmouth University afﬁrms the inestimable worth and dignity of every
individual, regardless of their condition of life. We afﬁrm, further, the
right of each person to develop to their full potential and to be judged
on the basis of personal accomplishments. Finally, we believe that the
achievement of full humanity is enhanced by the experience of the
human family.
We are committed to achieving and sustaining a pluralistic environment
recognized for its racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity, and which is
characterized by genuine mutuality, acceptance, afﬁrmation of the
strengths and contributions of differing individuals and groups, and a
willingness to resolve disputes in a spirit of good will.
Monmouth University, through this philosophy and policy statement,
seeks to create a pluralistic community in which people:
• are accepted and judged as individuals, independent of ancestry,
social and economic background, sexual orientation, age, gender,
gender identity, physical characteristics, personal beliefs or any
protected classes;
• may freely engage in constructive academic dialogue and debate in
classrooms and public halls, and pursue their social and private lives
uninhibited by discrimination, disruption, or harassment in any form
and;
• value, respect, and draw their intellectual strength from the rich
diversity of other peoples of different races, cultures, religions,
nationalities, and beliefs.
This afﬁrmation and commitment will guide us in the challenging times
ahead as we strive to achieve excellence in service, teaching, and
scholarship.

The University

THE UNIVERSITY
Monmouth University, as described in its Mission Statement, is
an independent, comprehensive institution of higher education,
emphasizing excellence and integrity in teaching, and scholarship at the
undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate levels. Monmouth is dedicated
to service in the public interest and, in particular, to the enhancement
of the quality of life. The University is committed to providing a learning
environment that enables men and women to pursue their educational
goals, to reach their full potential as leaders, to determine the direction of
their lives, and to contribute actively in order to become engaged citizens
in their community and society in an increasingly interdependent world.
Seven schools within the University—the Wayne D. McMurray School of
Humanities and Social Sciences; the School of Science; the Leon Hess
Business School; the School of Education; the Marjorie K. Unterberg
School of Nursing and Health Studies; the Honors School; and the School
of Social Work—provide a wide variety of academic programs at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels. There are bachelor’s degree programs
in the arts and sciences and in the professional areas of business,
computer science, criminal justice, education, nursing, social work, and
software engineering. Co-curricular activities have been designed to
complement the academic programs. Master’s level programs include
addiction studies, anthropology, business administration (M.B.A.), clinical
mental health counseling, computer science, communication, creative
writing (M.F.A.), criminal justice, education (M.Ed., M.S.Ed., and M.A.T.),
English, history, information systems, nursing, physician assistant, social
work, software engineering, and speech-language pathology. The School
of Nursing and Health Studies offers doctorate level programs: Doctor
of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) and the Occupational Therapy Doctorate
(2021). The School of Education offers a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in
Educational Leadership and a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Educational
Leadership - Higher Education Track.
The undergraduate curriculum is built upon an innovative,
interdisciplinary general education program and careful academic
advising and career counseling. One of the University’s main goals is to
prepare Monmouth undergraduates for active participation as leaders in
the twenty-ﬁrst century. Accordingly, the University provides a learning
environment that enables all students to develop their capacities for
leadership in a multicultural world. Students are provided opportunities
to develop information technology and collaborative problem-solving
skills and to develop a sense of social responsibility as members of local,
national, and global communities. Small classes and course clustering
allow for individual attention, cooperative learning, and interactive
student-faculty exchange.
The University is located in a quiet, residential area of an attractive
community near the Atlantic Ocean, about an hour and thirty minutes
from the metropolitan attractions of New York City and Philadelphia.
Monmouth enjoys the advantage of proximity, within its home county, to
many high-technology ﬁrms, ﬁnancial institutions, healthcare institutions,
and a thriving business-industrial sector. These provide employment
possibilities for Monmouth University graduates, as well as opportunities
for undergraduates to gain practical experience through internships. The
surrounding communities also offer opportunities for service activities in
local schools and public agencies.

Campus Facilities
The University’s 170-acre campus, considered to be one of the most
beautiful in New Jersey, includes among its seventy-ﬁve buildings a
harmonious blending of historic and traditional architectural styles.
The centerpiece building—and the University’s identifying landmark—is
the Great Hall at Shadow Lawn, the administrative center. Completed in
1931, the 130-room mansion—originally known as Shadow Lawn—began
as the private residence of Hubert T. Parson, a former president of F.W.
Woolworth Company. The mansion has been described in newspapers
throughout the world, is featured in many books on architecture and art,
and has been used as a backdrop for innumerable print ads and television
commercials. In 1981, it served as the setting for the ﬁlm version of
Annie. In 1978, along with the University’s Guggenheim Memorial Library,
another architectural treasure that was the summer home of Murray and
Leonie Guggenheim, it was entered in the National Register of Historic
Places. In 1985, The Great Hall at Shadow Lawn was designated a
National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior.
Monmouth University Graduate Center is located at 185 State Highway
36, West Long Branch, NJ. This center is approximately two miles from
the main campus and currently houses Athletic Training, the Department
of Professional Counseling, the Physician Assistant Program, the
Speech-Language Pathology Graduate Program, and the Center for
Speech and Language Disorders. The Center provides rehabilitation
services to the neighboring community on a free-service basis with a onetime per semester registration fee. Please call 732-923-4547 or e-mail
(MUSpeechCenter@monmouth.edu) the center with further questions.
The OceanFirst Bank Center is a 153,200-square-foot facility that seats
approximately 4,000 people. The building, which is located in the center
of the campus, includes a multipurpose arena; a 200-meter, six-lane
indoor track; the University store; Leon Hess Champions’ Hall, locker
rooms for nineteen athletic teams; box ofﬁce; ﬁtness center; and the
University’s Blue/White Club.
The Lauren K. Woods Theatre, a former carriage house that retains
many of its original architectural features, is just one of the many
gracious older buildings that lend distinctive balance to the modern
additions to the campus. Prominent among these newer buildings is
the Rebecca Stafford Student Center that houses an open computer
lab, dining room and food court, student ofﬁces, lounges, and a large
combination banquet/performance hall. In a ﬁrst-floor suite is the
Disability Services and Tutoring Center. On the lower level is the Center
for Student Success that includes Career Services, First-Year Advising
(which provides advising support to freshmen students), the Writing
Center, and a graduate student lounge. Other buildings include: the Magill
Commons, a student dining hall and conference center; the Thomas
A. Edison Science Building (with nearby greenhouse); Howard Hall,
housing the Pollak Theatre and many academic computing labs, as
well as a twenty-four-hour open lab; Bey Hall, the Leon Hess Business
School building, which contains case study classrooms, seminar rooms,
and a computer laboratory; McAllan Hall, which houses the School
of Education, the Marjorie K. Unterberg School of Nursing and Health
Studies, and the School of Social Work; the new state-of-the-art Jules
Plangere Center, which houses the department of Communication, World
Languages and Cultures, and a Faculty Resource Center; Pozycki Hall,
provides several classrooms including a 150-person lecture hall, a lab and
conference rooms, and Joan and Robert Rechnitz Hall, which houses the
department of Art and Design and the Rechnitz Gallery. William T. Boylan
Gymnasium; eleven traditional and suite-style, on-campus residence
halls: Beechwood, Cedar, Elmwood, Hesse, Laurel, Mullaney, Oakwood,

Undergraduate 20-21

Pinewood, Redwood, Spruce, and Willow Hall; and three apartmentstyle facilities: the Great Lawn Apartments, the Garden Apartments, and
Maplewood Hall. Additional off-campus housing is the University Bluffs,
a six-apartment-building complex located on 2.7 acres on the ocean in
Long Branch.

History
Monmouth University was founded in 1933 with federal assistance
as Monmouth Junior College, largely to provide opportunity for higher
education to area high school graduates who could not afford to go away
to college during the Depression. It was a two-year institution, holding
classes only in the evening. For a time it appeared uncertain whether
the College would have adequate funds to continue. With support from
students and the community, however, the fledgling College survived
the economic crisis and quickly assumed its present private status. In
1956, it was renamed Monmouth College and accredited by the state
to offer four-year programs leading to the baccalaureate degree. Less
than a decade later, it was authorized to offer master’s degree programs.
In March 1995, the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education
designated Monmouth a teaching university pursuant to N.J.A.C. 9:1-3.1
et seq.
Today, Monmouth offers more than ninety-ﬁve undergraduate and
graduate degree programs and concentrations. Monmouth University
also offers doctorate-level programs:
School of Nursing and Health Studies:
• Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.)
• Occupational Therapy Doctorate (OTD) (for 2021)
School of Education:
• Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership
• Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership - Higher
Education Track
Within Monmouth’s student body, thirty-two states and forty-eight foreign
countries are represented. More than 1,700 undergraduates are resident
students.

Accreditation
The University is licensed by the New Jersey Commission on Higher
Education and accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher
Education. In addition,
• the Leon Hess Business School is accredited by the AACSB

Business;

• The Master of Science Physician Assistant (MSPA) Program
(https://www.monmouth.edu/graduate/ms-physician-assistant/) is
accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for
the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA) (http://www.arc-pa.org/).
At its March 2019 meeting, the Accreditation Review Commission
on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA) extended
Accreditation-Probation status for the Monmouth University Physician
Assistant Program sponsored by Monmouth University until its next
review in March 2021.
Probation accreditation is a temporary accreditation status initially of not
less than two years. However, that period may be extended by the ARCPA for up to an additional two years if the ARC-PA ﬁnds that the program
is making substantial progress toward meeting all applicable standards
but requires additional time to come into full compliance. Probation
accreditation status is granted, at the sole discretion of the ARC-PA, when
a program holding an accreditation status of Accreditation - Provisional
or Accreditation - Continued does not, in the judgment of the ARC-PA,
meet the Standards or when the capability of the program to provide an
acceptable educational experience for its students is threatened.
Once placed on probation, a program that fails to comply with
accreditation requirements in a timely manner, as speciﬁed by the ARCPA, may be scheduled for a focused site visit and is subject to having its
accreditation withdrawn.
Speciﬁc questions regarding the Program and its plans should be
directed to the Program Director and/or the appropriate institutional
ofﬁcial(s).
The program’s accreditation history can be viewed on the ARC-PA
website at http://www.arc-pa.org/accreditation-history-monmouthuniversity/.
• The entry-level occupational therapy doctoral degree program has
applied for accreditation and has been granted Candidacy Status
by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education
(ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA),

652-AOTA and its web address is www.acoteonline.org (http://
www.acoteonline.org). The program must have a preaccreditation
review, complete an on-site evaluation, and be granted Accreditation
Status before its graduates will be eligible to sit for the national
certiﬁcation examination for the occupational therapist administered
by the National Board for Certiﬁcation in Occupational Therapy
(NBCOT). After successful completion of this exam, the individual will
be an Occupational Therapist, Registered (OTR). In addition, all states
require licensure in order to practice; however, state licenses are
usually based on the results of the NBCOT Certiﬁcation Examination.
Note that a felony conviction may affect a graduate’s ability to sit for
the NBCOT certiﬁcation examination or attain state licensure.

The Faculty
The faculty at Monmouth University work together to provide challenging
classroom environments that encourage student involvement and ensure
that Monmouth graduates leave the University ready to exercise socially
responsible leadership in their professional and personal communities.
The faculty take teaching and student learning seriously. To enhance
their effectiveness, most have participated in faculty workshops on active
learning techniques.

biology professor, who provides opportunity for students in his major
ﬁeld to participate in his environmental projects, also encourages them
to write papers on their work and to present them at scientiﬁc meetings.
“For some,” he reports, “this experience has been a determining factor in
gaining acceptance to graduate school or in getting jobs in their major
ﬁeld. Being able to include published research in their résumés gives
them a decided edge.” A psychology professor whose undergraduate
students have presented papers at prestigious, professional psychology
conferences is enthusiastic about their experiences. “They have truly
earned the recognition they received and are excited about pursuing
advanced degrees.”
Monmouth faculty are committed to helping students achieve their fullest
potential. That they succeed is attested in the words of a graduate who
is now a successful physicist. “Any student who has anything on the ball,
and who wants to learn and get the ﬁnest education possible in his or
her major ﬁeld, can get it at Monmouth. The teachers are tops; they care
about you as an individual, work right along with you, and share the joy
of your own successes. I was a science major. When they saw that I was
serious about my work, my professors gave me special encouragement,
allowed me flexible lab privileges, and even worked with me on research.
I knew it was a great experience then. Five years into my career ﬁeld, I am
even more appreciative of the solid kind of preparation provided me at
Monmouth. Just show the faculty you care, and you’ll have them on your
team all the way.”

The Monmouth faculty are respected scholars, artists, scientists, and
professionals. Students are drawn into the ongoing scholarly and
creative work of the faculty through classroom demonstration, research
assistantships, and attendance at professional meetings. Faculty also
serve as advisors to students, some as designated freshman advisors
who work closely with new students during their ﬁrst year.

Distinguished Teaching Award

In departments having graduate programs, certain faculty are
appointed to the graduate faculty. The graduate faculty provide the
core of instruction in the graduate programs at Monmouth University.
Recognized for their scholarly achievements by peers in their ﬁelds,
the members of the graduate faculty provide a challenging classroom
environment. They bring insight from research and professional
experience into the classroom. Graduate students are drawn into the
ongoing, creative work of the faculty through classroom demonstration,
as research assistants, and through attendance at professional meetings.
The graduate faculty also serve as advisors and mentors to students; in
many cases, contact is maintained after graduation.

Working directly with senior faculty who are engaged in research is a
key element in graduate-level study. In recent interviews, a group of
student leaders on campus unanimously agreed that the opportunity to
work closely with faculty is the greatest single beneﬁt of Monmouth’s
small class size and engaged faculty. Students are able to achieve a
comfortable rapport with the professors.
Interviewed recently about their views of the University, a group of
student leaders on campus unanimously agreed the greatest single
appeal of the institution was the opportunity it afforded them to work
closely with faculty, to achieve a comfortable rapport in which they not
only got to know their teachers, but also were known by them. “We are
never made to feel we are simply numbers,” one of the student leaders
stated.
A member of the anthropology faculty, who regularly involves students
in his research activities, explains: “It gives them opportunity to meet
important people in the ﬁeld whom they otherwise would only read about,
and to engage in some of the personal excitement of anthropology.” A

Each year at Commencement, the University cites one member of the
faculty for distinguished teaching. Honorees are chosen by a committee
of faculty, administrators, and students. Recipients since 1975, when the

Academic Honesty
Monmouth University encourages its students to grow intellectually
as well as to become responsible citizens in our complex society. To
develop their skills and talents, students are asked to conduct research,
perform experiments, write papers, work individually, and cooperate in
group activities. Academic dishonesty subverts the University’s mission
and undermines the student’s intellectual growth. Dishonesty in such
academic practices as assignments, examinations, or other academic
work cannot be condoned. A student who submits work that is not
original violates the purpose of Monmouth University and may forfeit his/
her right and opportunity to continue at the University.
The University has an obligation as an educational institution
to be certain that each student’s work is his/her own. Note that
Monmouth University faculty members have access to Turnitin (http://
www.turnitin.com), a Web-based plagiarism-detection resource that
compares the text of student papers to an extensive electronic database.
This database includes current and archived Internet resources,
periodicals, journals and other publications, and past student papers from
Monmouth and other educational institutions. All student assignments
may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to Turnitin
(http://www.turnitin.com/) for the detection of plagiarism. All submitted
papers may be included as source documents in the Turnitin reference

database (solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers).
Faculty are expected to inform students in advance about which
assignments will be checked for originality using Turnitin. Use of the
Turnitin service is subject to the Usage Policy posted on the Turnitin site
(http://www.turnitin.com/).

the start term of their senior year. Applications received after the March 1
deadline will be considered on a space-available basis. Regular decision
candidates who complete an application by March 1 will be notiﬁed of an
admission decision by April 1.

Admission to Monmouth is based upon many factors. Recognizing that
each student is different, Monmouth makes every attempt to ensure
that its selection process is as fair to each student as possible. The
admission process is need-blind, i.e., a family’s ability to pay for college is
not considered.

The application deadline for Nursing (BSN freshman applicants only) is
December 1 and may have special requirements. BSN candidates who
complete an application by December 1 will be notiﬁed of an admission
decision by January 15. Refer to the current Monmouth University
Application for Undergraduate Admission for information.

Admission to the University is at the discretion of the Admission
Committee under the guidance and supervision of the Director of
Undergraduate Admission. The applicant pool for fall admission
changes each year; admission guidelines are established based upon
the applicant pool and strategic objectives of the University. Factors
considered in the application review process include the high school
transcript with focus on cumulative grade point average and rigor of
course work, standardized test scores, letter(s) of recommendation,
essay, activities/work experience, community service, and leadership
roles. (The Committee reserves the right to make admission exceptions
on the basis of the student’s overall application and potential for success
at Monmouth University.)

The application deadline for the 4+2 B.S. in Health Studies & Minor in
Communication Sciences and Disorders/M.S.Ed. in Speech-Language
Pathology program is December 1 and may have special requirements.

the early decision program are asked to withdraw all other applications
to other colleges and universities and accept the offer of admission.
Applicants may be offered admission, denied admission, or returned to
the regular applicant pool for further consideration.
The application deadline for early action is December 1. Early action is a
nonbinding program geared toward students who meet the overall criteria
for admission and have a strong desire to enroll at Monmouth. Early
action candidates will be notiﬁed of an admission decision by January

Credit Accumulation
Advanced Standing
Monmouth University grants college credit (Advanced Standing) for
secondary school courses that have been validated by the Advanced
Placement Examination Board. In most cases, credit is awarded for
Monmouth University course equivalents of the subject matter covered
by the examination when the AP examination scores are 3, 4, or 5. See
the Advanced Placement Exams chart (p. 23) for speciﬁc Monmouth
equivalencies.
Monmouth University accepts International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma
Program Credit based on Higher Level examination achievement.
Scores of a 5, 6, or 7 must be earned in order to receive credit for the
IB. International Baccalaureate courses are graded on a scale of 1
(minimum) to 7 (maximum). Ofﬁcial IB transcripts should be forwarded to
the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission for ofﬁcial evaluation. Monmouth
does not grant IB credits for subjects taken at the Standard Level.
Students will be given credit in speciﬁc subject areas on a courseby-course basis; credit policies will be determined by the academic
department to which the credit will be transferred. Please refer to the
International Baccalaureate chart (p. 24) for speciﬁc Monmouth
equivalencies.
Monmouth University will grant three (3) credits as a Political Science
elective for students who enroll at Monmouth University and who have
successfully completed The American Legion Jersey Boys State Program
(ALJBS).

Credits in Escrow
Monmouth University provides a taste of college life as well as a head
start in college for secondary school students who have completed at
least their junior year. Credits earned are held in escrow and may be
applied toward a degree at Monmouth after the student is matriculated
as a regular student, or they may be transferred. By taking advantage of
this opportunity and with careful planning of course sequences, it may
be possible for a student to complete requirements for a baccalaureate
degree in three calendar years.
Monmouth University also grants credit for college courses taken at
another accredited institution while the student was still attending high

A candidate for admission who has been homeschooled is asked to
follow these guidelines in the application process. Please note that
all homeschooled students are required to meet their home state
requirements and submit appropriate supporting documentation
demonstrating that they have done so, should they be asked to do so by
Monmouth University. Applicants should:
1. Complete the Common Application (https://www.commonapp.org/)
in full and submit to Monmouth University.
2. Submit the nonrefundable application fee.
3. Submit one of the following credentials:
a. Transcript from a homeschool program, private school, or

education was completed in a conventional public or private
high school, Monmouth University requires the transcript of that
academic work be sent directly from the registrar of that school.
Additionally, if you have completed any college-level course work
while in high school or to satisfy graduation requirements, submit
all ofﬁcial transcripts. If course work is still in progress, submit a

Transfer Applicants
Monmouth University welcomes applications from transfer students
who are in good academic standing at other accredited colleges or
universities. Students from non-accredited colleges may be admitted
if they satisfy the admission requirements of Monmouth University.
Students with a cumulative GPA of 2.25 or better will be considered
for admission to the University. Students pursuing a major within the
School of Education must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 according to
New Jersey State Guidelines. Please refer to the School of Education
section of this catalog for additional State guidelines. Admission is
determined by successful completion of course work over time and
is not automatic; there may be instances when a student with a 2.25
GPA or greater will not be offered admission. Students who have been
dismissed for academic reasons will not be considered for acceptance by

25

Monmouth University until at least one academic semester has elapsed
following their dismissal. Students suspended for disciplinary reasons
from another institution must serve the term imposed by that suspension
before Monmouth University will consider their application for admission.
Students offered provisional admission must be nonmatriculated and
part-time. Conditions imposed on such students are as follows:
• they may earn no more than eighteen credits in that status and may
carry no more than nine (9) credits per semester;
• they must reapply for admission after earning twelve to eighteen
credits at Monmouth in order to matriculate and continue taking
courses at the University.
Admission as a matriculating student is contingent upon successful
completion of course work. (See the Changing from Non-Matriculated to
Matriculated Status (p. 69) section of the catalog for more details.)
The priority application deadline for the spring semester is December
1. The priority application deadline for the fall semester is July 15. If a
student has attempted and received grades in twenty-four credits or more
at or above the 100-level, the University will only look at the student’s
collegiate course work in determining admission. If a student has fewer
than twenty-four credits, an ofﬁcial high school transcript and ofﬁcial SAT
or ACT scores are requested.
Transfer students must send ofﬁcial transcripts from all institutions
attended previously, regardless of whether or not credit for such work
is desired or expected. Final transcripts from previous institutions
attended must be received by Monmouth University prior to beginning
enrollment. Students who do not provide ofﬁcial transcripts will not be
permitted to continue at Monmouth. Failure to declare attendance at
any postsecondary institution where registration occurred may lead to
disciplinary action and/or dismissal. When applying for transfer credit,
students may be requested to submit ofﬁcial course descriptions.

Articulation Agreements
Monmouth University currently has program articulation agreements
with Brookdale Community College, Ocean County College, Mercer
County Community College, Raritan Valley Community College, and
Union County College. Similar agreements are in development with
other two-year colleges. If you are interested in one of the existing
agreements, please contact either the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission
at 732-571-3456 or Transfer Services in the Center for Student Success
(CSS) at 732-571-3588.

Credit Transfer
Transfer students who have been admitted to the University will receive
an ofﬁcial transfer credit evaluation. Students who fail to declare
attendance at any postsecondary institution where they had been
registered automatically waive the right to have that work considered for
transfer credit and are subject to disciplinary action and/or suspension.
Grades earned at previous institutions are not reflected in the Monmouth
University grade point average (GPA). (Education majors may transfer
a maximum of six professional credits from a two-year school.) Due
to the individual review process required for evaluating music and art
course work, students in these disciplines may require an audition or
a portfolio review to determine equivalency for certain course work.
Students attending an accredited two-year institution in New Jersey may

26

Credit Transfer

ﬁnd transfer equivalencies through the New Jersey Transfer Initiative
(http://www.njtransfer.org).
All candidates for bachelor’s degrees must complete the University’s
general education requirements. Note that the course type(s) associated
with a course are speciﬁc to course work taken at Monmouth University.
Courses earned through transfer equivalency will not automatically
earn the course type associated with the Monmouth University course
equivalent. For instructions on how to have a transfer course reviewed to
fulﬁll the General Education requirements of Technological Literacy (TL),
Reasoned Oral Discourse (RD), Interdisciplinary Studies (ISP), Cultural
Diversity (CD), Global Understanding (GU), or Experiential Education (EX),
students should contact the Director of Transfer Student Services and
Undeclared Students and may also refer to the general education transfer
equivalencies (p. 27) for more details. Prospective students may
contact the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission for further information.
For undergraduate students who attended accredited (by the Commission
on Higher Education) two-year community or county colleges, the following

University, providing these credits fulﬁll degree requirements.
Students who attended both two-year and four-year institutions may
apply a maximum of twenty-one additional credits at the 200-level
or higher (as determined by the four-year institution where these
courses were taken) toward baccalaureate degree requirements
at Monmouth University, providing these credits fulﬁll degree
requirements. Students who attended only a four-year institution
may apply a maximum of ninety credits toward a baccalaureate
degree at Monmouth University, providing these credits fulﬁll degree
requirements.
2. Full-time students at accredited community or county colleges who
have maintained continuous semester-to-semester attendance and
who graduate in ﬁve or fewer semesters in AA, AS, or AAS (nursing
only) degree programs will be considered for acceptance as transfer
students at Monmouth University. Provided such students begin their
enrollment at Monmouth in the ﬁrst or second semester immediately
following their graduation from the two-year institution, they may
elect to follow the Monmouth University curriculum that was in
effect at the time they entered the two-year college. Students must
request matriculation in the prior catalog by writing to the Ofﬁce of
the Registrar within the ﬁrst semester of attendance. Please be aware
that accreditation or state mandate may make a program unavailable.
3. All other graduates of accredited community or county colleges
who have earned AA, AS, or AAS (nursing only) degrees (full-time
students taking more than ﬁve semesters to graduate or part-time
students) will be considered for acceptance as transfer students at
Monmouth University. Provided such students begin their enrollment
at Monmouth in the ﬁrst or second semester immediately following
their graduation from the two-year institution, they may elect to
follow the Monmouth University curriculum that was in effect four
semesters prior to their enrollment at Monmouth.
For all other undergraduate students who attended accredited (by the

education course work.
c. No personal development or vocational (e.g., secretarial,
automotive) courses, unrelated to degree programs at Monmouth
University, will transfer. (The designation “vocational” will be
determined by the course description/syllabus, not necessarily by
the discipline designation assigned at the previous institution.)
d. Courses that are more than ﬁve years old may be declined by the
major department, but only in cases where the subject matter
of these courses has undergone signiﬁcant and substantial
additions/revisions.
2. Courses will transfer in at the Monmouth University equivalent.

residency requirements, please refer to the Academic Programs,
Support Services, and Regulations (p. 48) section of this Catalog.
4. Students changing majors will have their transfer credits re-evaluated
by the new major department.
5. Undergraduate students who attended a study abroad program
through their former institutions may be eligible for Experiential
Education credit at Monmouth. The student must have earned a
minimum of six credits at the foreign institution, with grades of “C”
or better. The study abroad courses must be noted on the academic
transcript of the American institution and annotated as “study
abroad.” See the Ofﬁce of the Registrar for additional information.
For undergraduate students who attended non-foreign, nonaccredited
programs:
Courses other than nursing courses will transfer automatically only if
a formal document of course equivalencies exists that was previously
adopted by the University. When a formal document does not exist,
courses taken in these nonaccredited programs will be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis by the appropriate departments to determine
acceptability for transfer. In all instances, conditions one through four
above apply.
For nursing majors, nursing courses will transfer as described within
the Nursing and Health Studies section of this Catalog. Non-nursing
majors who have graduated from a diploma nursing school may transfer
nursing courses by taking as many as four ACT/PEP tests as speciﬁed
by the School of Nursing and Health Studies at Monmouth University.
Each successfully passed examination may transfer as eight credits
(8) of lower-division nursing courses. These credits may apply to the
requirements of the major program as applicable. Students should
consult with their major department chair for details.
For undergraduate students who attended foreign institutions:
The Monmouth University Transcript Evaluator will evaluate credits
submitted from foreign institutions. Transcripts that are not in English
must be translated and evaluated by a reputable credential evaluation
service, including members of the National Association of Credential
Evaluation Services (NACES). Course descriptions in English must
accompany transcripts. In all instances, conditions one through four

Monmouth University grants three credits for each of the ﬁve General
Examinations, completed with a minimum score of 52. CLEP exams taken
prior to July 1, 2001, require a minimum score of 481.
Monmouth University grants credit to the subject matter covered by the
examination when the score is at or above the ﬁftieth percentile.
EN-202 Literature II: Neoclassical to the Present (3 cr.) equivalent for nonEnglish majors only.
Monmouth University does not accept CLEP test results after a student
has been enrolled.

Credit by Examination
Credit by Examination is a process for granting academic credit for a life
experience with an academic parallel. The term “life experience” connotes
a learning experience equivalent to an academic course in an accredited
institution on the college level. Credits obtained by examination are
accorded the same status as transfer credit and consequently are
not used in the computation of the grade point average. Credit by
examination is counted as part of the maximum allowable transfer
credits for an academic program. Undergraduate students earning credits
by examination for languages cannot use these credits to satisfy the
cultural diversity (CD), global understanding (GU) or world language
(WL) general education requirement. These credits will not be included
in the thirty credits needed to fulﬁll the Monmouth University residency
requirement, but may be taken at any time during the student’s career at
Monmouth.
Interested students should apply to the appropriate academic
departments. Details about these procedures are available in the Ofﬁce of
the Registrar.

Applied Music
Applied Music is private instruction in a particular instrument or voice.
The student should discuss his/her desire to take applied music with a
Monmouth University music faculty member and then register directly
in the Music Department. The student may earn as many as six (6)
credits in Applied Music and will be awarded the credit after successful
completion of the lessons and the payment of the credit by examination
fee. Credit for Applied Music will be treated in the same manner as credit
by examination (see above).
Additional guidelines are available online on the Ofﬁce of the Registrar
forms Web page (http://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/forms.asp).

Prior Learning/Portfolio Assessment
Program
Students who have been working, managing a home, volunteering in the
community, traveling, serving in the military, or studying independently
may have acquired some college-level learning from these experiences.
It is possible to have this learning evaluated and receive credit. Credit
is granted for learning rather than the experience itself, and is awarded
when the learning is closely related to the subject matter of a Monmouth
course. Students who wish to earn credit for learning from work and
life experience will be asked to prepare a portfolio that describes and
documents that learning. Additional information is available from the
Ofﬁce of the Registrar.

Former Students Applying for
Readmission
Readmission to the University
Former Monmouth University students not on a Leave of Absence
who have not attended the University for at least one semester must
submit a request for readmission (https://apply.monmouth.edu/register/
readmission/) and may need to submit an application fee. If the applicant
has attended another institution in the interim, the applicant must have
an ofﬁcial transcript forwarded to the Ofﬁce of Admission Processing.
Students will be re-evaluated based upon the full academic record and
will be advised if further information is needed.

Readmission to the University after
Academic Dismissal
Students who have been academically dismissed may apply for
readmission. Review of the application and the ensuing decision is made
by the Academic Standards and Review Committee. Previously dismissed
students seeking readmission must have been away from the University
for one full semester. Students who have been dismissed twice may
apply for readmission after a minimum of three years. Application must
be made through the Ofﬁce of Admission.

Application for Academic Amnesty
(See Academic Amnesty (p. 64).)

Visiting Students
Students from other institutions must provide a letter of permission
from, and be in good academic and disciplinary standing at, the home
institution. The student should apply online through the Undergraduate
Permission Enrollment Application (https://apply.monmouth.edu/
register/PNMapplication/). Admission as a visiting student does not
constitute admission as a matriculated student. Eligible rising high
school seniors may enroll in college-level course work at Monmouth
University. Eligibility will be determined by the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate
Admission based on a review of the student’s academic credentials.

Adult Applicants
Monmouth University endeavors to support lifelong learning by providing
services and programs—degree and nondegree, credit and noncredit
—that enable nontraditional students to meet their varied educational
needs and goals.
Program 65 affords opportunity for persons 65 years of age or older to
enroll for study at Monmouth University at reduced tuition. Admission
requirements include the designated nonrefundable application fee and
proof of age. Enrollment is on a space-available basis. Those interested
in learning more about Program 65 may contact either the Ofﬁce of
Undergraduate or Graduate Admission.

1. demonstration of academic ability,
2. English language proﬁciency, and
3. sufﬁcient ﬁnancial support.
Applicants for admission whose native language is not English must
demonstrate English language proﬁciency. Such proﬁciency may
be demonstrated by submitting an ofﬁcial score report from one of
the following standardized tests and meeting the minimum score
requirements. Students who have completed the equivalent of a
baccalaureate or master’s degree at an accredited institution in a native,
English-speaking country may be exempt from these standardized testing
requirements. For a current list of additional ways to meet the English
language proﬁciency requirement please contact the Admission Ofﬁce at

Note that exceptions to minimum score requirements for graduate
programs may be made upon recommendation of the graduate program
director within the student’s major department and with approval
from the Vice Provost of Graduate Studies. Monmouth also requires a
student’s academic proﬁle to meet regular standards for admission.

Monmouth University will also accept international students who meet
Monmouth’s regular standards for admission and who have successfully
completed the ELS Language Services program at the master’s level of
English proﬁciency, which is completion of Level 112, in lieu of the TOEFL
or other English proﬁciency exam. Conditional acceptance may be issued
by Monmouth University to those students who elect to prove English
proﬁciency by enrolling in and completing ELS Level 112.
In order to obtain the nonimmigrant Certiﬁcate of Eligibility (Form I-20),
all accepted international applicants are required to provide ﬁnancial
documentation, such as bank statements, attesting that sufﬁcient funds

Credentials submitted from foreign institutions will be evaluated by
the Transcript Evaluator for credit transfer. Ofﬁcial college transcripts
for all college-level work, regardless of whether the credit will be
transferrable, must be sent directly from the institution at which the credit
was completed. Ofﬁcial transcripts, mark sheets, diplomas, degrees,
and/or certiﬁcates of all secondary and post-secondary academic
records and examination results are required. If fewer than twenty-four
transferrable credits have been completed, high school/secondary school
transcripts must also be provided. Transcripts that are not in English
must be translated and evaluated by a reputable credential evaluation
service, including members of the National Association of Credential
Evaluation Services (NACES), and then sent directly from the agency to
Monmouth University. A course-by-course evaluation is required for all
non-English transcripts. Course descriptions in English of all completed
course work are also required if not included in the course-by-course
evaluation. Transcripts are considered ofﬁcial when sent directly to
Monmouth University from the college/university at which the courses
were taken and certiﬁed by the institution’s Registrar’s Ofﬁce, Ministry of
Education, or when sent directly from the evaluation agency along with
the translation and evaluation to the Ofﬁce of Admission Processing.
Photocopied documents or transcripts marked “issued to student” are
not accepted as ofﬁcial.
The records should list all courses the student has taken and grades
received in each subject. Course descriptions and/or syllabi and the
number of weeks and hours spent in lectures and laboratory work
for each course are required of transfer applicants if transfer credit
is expected. Only credits from recognized accredited institutions will
be considered for direct transfer into any degree program. All course
work is subject to approval by the department chair of the speciﬁc
program chosen; not all courses may transfer. A maximum of seventy-two
credits will be allowed for undergraduates transferring from a two-year
accredited institution; a maximum of ninety-six credits will be allowed
when transferring from a four-year accredited institution.
Course work done through national examination may be considered for
credit by department evaluation, credit by examination, waiver, or portfolio
if results meet speciﬁc department and/or University requirements and
standards.
Students may, upon request, be required to have previous academic
work validated, at the student’s expense, through an outside credential
evaluation service.

Undergraduate 20-21

Failure to declare and/or present all academic work, or presentation of
academic records that are found to be altered or of a questionable nature,
may result in non-acceptance of student or dismissal of student from
the University. Generally, international students currently studying in
the United States who wish to transfer to Monmouth University should
follow the regular transfer admission process. The English proﬁciency/
SAT requirement can be waived for international students who have
completed at least twenty-four transferable credits of which at least three
are in English at the 100 level or higher. See details referenced in the
International Applicants section for English proﬁciency requirements. An
international student transferring from an institution within the United
States is asked to provide the following documentation:
• Common Application
• Nonrefundable application fee
• Ofﬁcial transcript(s)
• Ofﬁcial test scores (as applicable)
• Monmouth University’s F-1 Transfer form (http://
www.monmouth.edu/Student/grad/Transfer.pdf) if currently enrolled
at a U.S. institution and Monmouth University’s Application for Form
I-20 (http://www.monmouth.edu/uploadedFiles/Content/University/
admission/international-students/FormI20.pdf).
In addition, upon acceptance, the transfer applicant should request the
previous institution to transfer his or her Student and Exchange Visitor
Information System (SEVIS) record.
International transfer applicants must also provide ﬁnancial support
documentation (see details referenced in the International Applicants
section).

Explanation of Tuition, Fees and
Deposits
Tuition Charges: Undergraduate students are billed according to
their status as matriculated full-time or part-time students. Full-time
undergraduate students will be billed, upon registering for a given
semester, for tuition at the full-time rate; those who register for more
than eighteen credits will have an additional charge for each credit over
eighteen, billed at the part-time rate. Part-time students are billed at the
per-credit rate. Undergraduate students wishing to change status must
process a Request to Change Enrollment Status form with the Ofﬁce of
the Bursar. In addition, part-time, non-matriculated students must receive

34

Veterans' Beneﬁts Policy

approval of the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission before a change to
full-time status can be processed.

Credit by Examination Fee: This fee is for the administrative and
personnel costs for the Credit by Examination program.

Under this policy, undergraduate students whose status is full time will be
billed at the full-time rate, regardless of the number of credits for which
they are registered, until a Request to Change Enrollment Status form
is processed. If a full-time student fails to register for a full-time load by
the end of the registration period, the University will adjust the billing
and change the student’s status accordingly. An undergraduate student
whose status is part-time will be billed at the part-time per-credit rate,
unless registered for twelve or more credits (then the student will be
billed at the full-time rate). Summer tuition will be billed at the per-credit
rate regardless of status.

Portfolio Assessment Fee: This fee is for the administrative and
personnel costs for the Portfolio Assessment program.

Financial Aid awards will be based on the student’s status, and students
should be aware that change in status may affect Financial Aid eligibility.
Graduate students are assessed tuition on a per-credit basis. Students
should be aware that the number of enrolled credits may affect Financial
Aid eligibility.
Comprehensive Fee: The Comprehensive Fee includes services provided
by the Student Center, Student Activities, Health Center, Intercollegiate
and Intramural Athletics, Placement, Counseling, and Registration.
Application Fee: This nonrefundable fee is for the cost of processing
undergraduate and graduate applications.
Acceptance Deposit: This deposit must be paid by all new full-time
undergraduate students (twelve or more credits) prior to registration.
Acceptance deposits paid by transfer students are not refundable.
Acceptance deposits paid by freshmen for the fall semester are
refundable until May 1.
Orientation Fee: This fee is charged to new students to cover the
expenses of the orientation program.
Late Payment Fee: A fee is charged to all students who have not properly
made ﬁnal ﬁnancial arrangements with the Bursar by the payment due
date.
Parking Fee: This fee is charged to all resident students who register a
motor vehicle with the campus police. Failure to register vehicles will
result in parking ﬁnes.
Returned Check Fee: A fee is charged for each uncollectible check issued
to the University.
Residence Hall Room Reservation Deposit: Students who wish to
reserve space in the residence halls are required to forward a $150 room
reservation deposit and signed contract prior to registration. The $150 is
applied as a credit toward room rent.
Residence Hall Contract Cancellation Fee: This fee is charged to students
who have contracted to reserve space in the residence hall and fail to
cancel that contract prior to June 1. This fee is in addition to forfeiture of
the room reservation deposit.
Physical Education Fee: This fee is for the use of equipment required in
the physical education program.
Laboratory and Studio Fee: This fee is charged in addition to the tuition
for each laboratory or studio course. It covers costs of additional class
hours and special materials.

Study Abroad Fee: This fee is charged to Monmouth University students
who have been granted permission to enroll in a Study Abroad program
sponsored by another college or university.
Student Teacher Early Field Experience Fee: This fee is charged to
education majors to offset the expense of the early ﬁeld experience.
Student Teaching Field Experience Fee: This fee is charged to education
majors to offset the expense of student teaching.
Clinical Laboratory and Practicum Fee: This fee is charged to offset the
additional costs associated with certain clinical laboratory and practicum
courses.

Veterans' Beneﬁts Policy
In accordance with Title 38 U.S. Code 3679 subsection (e), Monmouth
University has adopted the following additional provisions for any
students using U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Post 9/11®
G.I.Bill (Chapter 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
(Chapter 31) beneﬁts, while payment to the institution is pending from
Veterans' Affairs.

Monmouth University will not:
• Prevent the students enrollment;
• Assess a late penalty fee;
• Require VA students obtaining beneﬁts to secure alternative or
additional funding;
• Deny their access to any resources (access to classes, libraries, or
other institutional facilities) available to other students who have
satisﬁed their tuition and fee bills to the institution.

However, to qualify for this provision, such students
may be required to:
• Provide Chapter 33 Certiﬁcate of Eligibility (or its equivalent) or
for Chapter 31, Veterans' Affairs Vocational Rehabilitation and
Employment (VR&E) contract with the school on VA Form 28-1905
by the ﬁrst day of class. *Note: Chapter 33 students can register at the
VA Regional Ofﬁce to use E-Beneﬁts to get the equivalent of a Chapter
33 Certiﬁcate of Eligibility. Chapter 31 students cannot get a completed
VA Form 28-1905 (or its equivalent) before the VA VR&E case manager
issues it to the school.
• Provide written request to be certiﬁed;
• Provide additional information needed to properly certify the
enrollment as described in other institutional policies.

Terms of Payment
Payment of fall semester charges are due in August, and spring semester
charges are due in December. Speciﬁc dates are set annually and can
be viewed on the Bursar Web page under “Payment Deadlines.” Billing
statements will be sent electronically to students and authorized users
designated by the student.

Undergraduate 20-21

Cash and Debit Card: accepted in person at the Ofﬁce of the Cashier
located on the ﬁrst floor of the Great Hall Annex. Call 732-571-7540.
Check or Money Order: accepted in person, as above, or mailed in the
envelope that is enclosed with your bill. The student's ID number must be
written on all checks and money orders.
Credit Cards: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express are
accepted. You may ﬁll out the form included with your bill and return it
in the envelope, also provided. This form of payment is also accepted
both in person and over the phone. The person to whom the credit card is
issued must call.
Online: by electronic check or credit card by logging into the Monmouth
University student portal, myMU. Select "Student Bill & Payment Center."
A student who does not meet their ﬁnancial obligations to the University
will be subject to deregistration from their courses for nonpayment.
Financial clearance must be met for a student to graduate or receive
transcripts, either ofﬁcial or unofﬁcial (student copy).
If payment is not made as required, the student will not be allowed to
register for future semesters/terms until the outstanding balance is
satisﬁed. In addition, all collection costs and fees, including, but not
limited to, attorneys’ fees incurred by the University, will be paid by the
student.

Tuition Payment Plan
To accommodate parents and students who prefer to pay for educational
expenses in monthly installments, payment plans are now available
through Student Bill & Payment Center. Starting June 1st prior to each
Fall semester, students can enroll in an estimated payment plan using an
estimation of their Fall semester balance. Once Fall semester charges
are posted on students' accounts, the estimated payment plan will
automatically revert to a real-time payment plan, which will capture
students' actual account balances and recalculate monthly installments
accordingly.
Students will be required to pay an Enrollment Fee of $45.00 upon
establishment of a monthly payment plan.
The Bursar's Ofﬁce provides answers to a list of frequently asked
questions (FAQs) regarding the payment plan on its web page.

Refund Policy
Summer Sessions
Refunds, upon withdrawal from summer sessions, will be made according
to the policy stated below:
• Students who withdraw from a four-week or six-week summer
session within the ﬁrst week of the session will receive 100 percent
refunds. Withdrawals after the ﬁrst week are not eligible for refunds.
• Students who withdraw from a nine-week or twelve-week summer
session within the ﬁrst week of the session will receive 100 percent
refunds. Fifty-percent refunds will be given if courses are withdrawn
in the second week. Withdrawals after the second week are not
eligible for refunds.

35

Refund Policy For Complete Withdrawals
Fall and Spring Semesters

Tuition and fees, including room and board fees, will be refunded upon
complete withdrawal from all semester courses according to the policy
stated below:
Students who withdraw completely from the University after the opening
of classes will receive 100 percent refunds (less a $500 cancellation fee
as detailed in the Housing Contract) through the end of the ﬁrst week
of the semester. Students who withdraw completely after the ﬁrst week
of the semester will receive pro-rata refunds (less a $500 cancellation
fee as detailed in the Housing Contract) calculated on the basis of days
enrolled through the sixtieth percent point in the semester. Example:
For a semester consisting of seventy-ﬁve days, the sixtieth percent
point would be the forty-ﬁfth day. Note that weekends are not included
toward days counted. Please refer to the Registration Information (http://
www.monmouth.edu/registrar/registration_information/default.asp)
online for semester start and end dates. Withdrawals after the sixtieth
percent point in the semester are not eligible for refunds.
All refunds will be based on the ofﬁcial date of withdrawal, which is
the date the completed withdrawal eFORM or an e-mail message (email must be from the student’s University e-mail account and sent to
the Registrar's Ofﬁce (registrar@monmouth.edu)) is received by the
Ofﬁce of the Registrar (OR). The University encourages students to make
notiﬁcation of withdrawal in writing as outlined above; however, verbal
communication in the form of a phone call to the OR will be accepted
within the following guidelines:
• The call must be made during business hours (Monday through
Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).
• The call must be communicated by the student (not a parent or
designate) directly to the OR personnel. Voice messages will not be
accepted.
• The student must provide name, last four digits of his or her social
security number, and his or her unique Monmouth student ID number.
• Telephone withdrawals will be conﬁrmed by the OR.
• The student is responsible for ensuring that the withdrawal is
communicated to the OR.
• International students cannot use e-mail or telephone contact with
the OR. International students must coordinate registrations and
withdrawals with the Ofﬁce of International Student Services.
Pro-rata percentages are applied against tuition, comprehensive fee, lab
fee, orientation fee, and room and board fees (less a $500 cancellation fee
for students who have contracted for housing). The resulting amount is
then compared to any student payments that may have been made with
the difference being the amount still due the University or the amount
available to be refunded. There will be no refunding of moneys paid
for health insurance, books, supplies, damages, ﬁnes, or other fees not
mentioned above. Any amount available for refund will be returned to
its sources. Federal Title IV aid, state aid, and University aid will receive
refunds prior to any refund being paid to the student.

Refund Policy for Partial Withdrawals
Fall and Spring Semesters

All refunds will be based on the ofﬁcial date of withdrawal, which is the
date the completed withdrawal eFORM is received by the Ofﬁce of the
Registrar (OR). E-mail or verbal communication will not be accepted for

36

Refund Policy

communicating partial withdrawals to OR. Only the completed withdrawal
eFORM will be accepted.
Full-time undergraduate students who are registered for twelve to
eighteen credits in the semester are not entitled to any refund when
withdrawing from one or more, but not all, courses after the ﬁrst week of
the semester. If the student drops below twelve credits prior to the end
of the ﬁrst week of the semester, the student’s status will be changed to
part-time, and the student will be billed at the per-credit rate. Full-time
undergraduate students should note that enrolling for fewer than twelve
credits may affect eligibility for ﬁnancial aid. Those students who are
registered for credits in excess of eighteen will be entitled to refunds
for tuition paid for credits in excess of eighteen according to the partial
withdrawal refund schedule for part-time undergraduate students and
graduate students, which follows below.
Part-time undergraduate students and all graduate students who
withdraw from one or more courses during the semester while remaining
registered for one or more courses are entitled to 100 percent refunds on
the courses dropped if the courses are dropped during the ﬁrst week of
the semester or on the day following the ﬁrst class meeting. Fifty-percent
refunds will be given if the courses are withdrawn from during the second
week. Withdrawals after the second week are not eligible for refunds.

Housing Contract: Refund Schedule
Students who change housing and/or board arrangements during the
semester while continuing as students at Monmouth University are
eligible only for such refunds (less a $500 cancellation fee as detailed
in the Housing Contract) as established by the Ofﬁce of Residential
Life. Further information on this process is available from the Ofﬁce of
Residential Life at 732-571-3465.

Appeal Policy for Refunds
Appeals for exceptions to the Refund Policy should be made in writing to
the Assistant to the Vice President for Student Financial Appeals within
one year of the beginning of the semester in question. Information about
this process is available from the Ofﬁce of the Vice President of Finance
at 732- 571-3427. Further information or explanation of the Refund Policy
(http://www.monmouth.edu/campus_life/bursar/refund.asp) is available
online from the Ofﬁce of the Bursar.
Students ﬁling appeals for exceptions to the University Refund Policy are
advised that there is a possibility that the amount of Financial Aid they
may receive, or may have received, may be adversely affected. Students
are advised that it is their responsibility to meet with a representative
from the Financial Aid Ofﬁce to see how ﬁling an appeal will affect their
ﬁnancial aid package.

Financial Aid

FINANCIAL AID

• Changes in the student’s enrollment (i.e., credit hours) status
• Lack of satisfactory academic progress

Monmouth University believes that ﬁnancing a student’s education
should be a cooperative effort between the student and the institution.
To that end, the staff of the Financial Aid Ofﬁce is available to assist
students and their families in developing a comprehensive educational
ﬁnancial plan. Students and families are strongly encouraged to call
(732-571-3463) the Financial Aid Ofﬁce to engage in this planning
process. In light of current public health concerns and until further
notice, face to face meetings will take place via video call and by
appointment only.

Application Process
Monmouth University uses the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) as its primary application for all federal, state, and institutional
ﬁnancial aid programs; no supplementary applications are required.
Students must apply online (https://www.fafsa.gov).
The FAFSA is completed each year using the student’s and parents’
federal income tax data and should also include Monmouth University’s
Title IV School Code (002616). Where possible, students should utilize
the Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to import their tax information directly from
the IRS’s database into the FAFSA; once income data has been imported
no changes to that data should be made. Completed FAFSAs may be
submitted to the U.S. Department of Education on or after October 1,
2019 for the 2020-21 academic year.
Monmouth University does not have established deadlines for processing
ﬁnancial aid. However, students are encouraged to ﬁle as soon after
October 1 as possible, as funding for several types of ﬁnancial aid is
limited, and funds are awarded on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis. Further,
New Jersey residents must ﬁle the FAFSA to be considered for state
grant (TAG) eligibility and should be aware of the following FAFSA ﬁling
deadlines:
TAG Recipients

Deadline

First time TAG recipients

September 15 of the current
academic year

Prior TAG recipients

April 15 of the preceding academic
year

Spring Term only

February 15 of the current
academic year

Financial data provided on the FAFSA will be forwarded electronically
to the University and will be the basis for the creation of the student’s
ﬁnancial aid package. The ﬁnancial aid package will be communicated to
the student via the Financial Aid Award Letter. Award letters will be sent
electronically; prior to enrollment, new students will receive the award
letter at the email address they provided on the application for admission,
while continuing students will receive their electronic award letter at
their University e-mail address; students may also review their ﬁnancial
aid package via the ﬁnancial aid Self-Service portion of the University's
website.
Generally, the initial offer of ﬁnancial assistance delineated in the award
letter is non-negotiable. The ﬁnancial aid package may, however, be
altered as a result of one or more of the following conditions:
• Changes in the student’s housing status

• Receipt of ﬁnancial aid from an outside source
• Discrepancies noted as a result of the veriﬁcation process
(Note that the U.S. Department of Education selects applications
for veriﬁcation. The veriﬁcation process entails the comparison of actual
ﬁnancial data to that supplied on the FAFSA. Students selected for this
process will be notiﬁed by the Financial Aid Ofﬁce and will be asked to supply
copies of federal tax return transcripts [if the Data Retrieval Tool was not
utilized] and a completed veriﬁcation worksheet; additional documents may
also be requested. Instructions for submitting this documentation will be
provided by the Financial Aid Ofﬁce.)

Funding Sources
Funding Sources
The student’s ﬁnancial aid package may be comprised of a combination
of grant, scholarship, loan, and work-study funding. Grants and
scholarships are forms of assistance that do not have to be repaid, while
loans must be repaid with interest; work-study earnings are disbursed
to students in the form of a bi-weekly paycheck and do not credit to the
student's account. (Note that interest rates and repayment terms vary
as a function of the type of loan a student has secured.) The following
paragraphs identify and describe the types of funding available at
Monmouth University.

Undergraduate Grants and Scholarships
Monmouth University Academic Scholarships and
Grants

The primary form of assistance offered to full-time incoming freshmen
and transfer students is provided through the incentive grant, academic
grant, and academic excellence scholarship programs. Awards are made
by the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission to students who qualify on
the basis of their prior academic performance; awards are not based
upon ﬁnancial need. New freshmen are evaluated on the basis of their
cumulative high school grade point average and their standardized test
scores (e.g., SAT and ACT scores). Awards to transfer students with 24
or more transferrable credit hours are made based upon the student’s
cumulative college grade point average; for students with less than
24 transferrable credit hours the award is based upon the high school
grade point average and standardized test scores. For both new and
transfer students, award amounts will vary as a function of academic
performance.
Awards are renewable for the entirety of the student’s undergraduate
career, provided the student maintains full-time enrollment status (at
least twelve credit hours) each semester and satisfactory academic
progress; education majors may receive a prorated award during their
student teaching semester if they are only enrolled for nine credit
hours. Students receiving the incentive grant are required to maintain a
minimum cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0; academic grant
recipients must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average
of at least 2.5; and academic excellence scholarship recipients must
maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0. In the
event that the student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress,
the award may be reduced or cancelled.

Undergraduate 20-21

Incentive grants, academic grants, and academic excellence scholarships
may only be applied toward tuition assessed by Monmouth University,
and, therefore, cannot be applied toward housing costs; academic awards
are applicable to study abroad costs only when tuition is assessed by
Monmouth University, to study at the Washington Center, and to Medical
Laboratory Science and Clinical Laboratory Science majors who are
taking coursework not offered at Monmouth University; for students in
the Medical Laboratory Science and Clinical Lab Sciences programs, the
award will be prorated during the semester(s) in which course work is not
taken at Monmouth University. The award will be prorated by the amount
of the non-Monmouth tuition as a percentage of Monmouth tuition. These
awards will not be made in conjunction with other institutional beneﬁts
such as employee tuition remission or the tuition exchange program.
Awards are available only during the regular academic year (i.e., fall and
spring semesters) and are not offered during the summer term.

Transfer Science Scholarships
Scholarships are offered to full-time transfer students in a major within
the School of Science, who have completed an Associate's Degree at
any New Jersey Community College and who have a transfer cumulative
grade point average of at least 3.25. Candidates are identiﬁed by the
Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission; there is no separate application
process for the scholarship. The award is $3,500 per academic year and
is renewable. To renew, students must maintain full-time status, have
a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better, and remain a science
major.
The award may only be applied toward tuition assessed by Monmouth
University, and is applicable to costs associated with study abroad only
when tuition is assessed by Monmouth University. The award is also
available for Medical Laboratory Science or Clinical Laboratory Science
majors and will be prorated during the semester(s) in which course work
is not taken at Monmouth University; the award will be prorated by the
amount of the non-Monmouth tuition as a percentage of Monmouth
tuition. For education majors the award will be prorated in the student
teaching semester if the student is registered for fewer than 12 credits.
Awards will not be awarded in conjunction with other institutional
beneﬁts such as employee tuition remission or the tuition exchange
program. The grant in combination with all other grants, scholarships,
and need-based loans will not exceed direct cost (e.g., tuition, fees, and
room/board for resident students and tuition and fees for commuting
students). Awards are available only during the regular academic year
(i.e., fall and spring semesters) and are not offered during the summer
term.

Shadow Lawn Grants
Out-of-State Students
Grants are offered to ﬁrst-time, full-time students who are permanent
residents of a state other than New Jersey or who are international
students. Candidates are identiﬁed by the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate
Admission; there is no separate application process. The award is $8,000
per academic year and is renewable. To renew, students must maintain
full-time status and a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better.
The award may only be applied toward tuition assessed by Monmouth
University, and is applicable to costs associated with study abroad only
when tuition is assessed by Monmouth University. The award is also
available for Medical Laboratory Science or Clinical Laboratory Science
majors and will be prorated during the semester(s) in which course work
is not taken at Monmouth University; the award will be prorated by the
amount of the non-Monmouth tuition as a percentage of Monmouth

39

tuition. For education majors the award will be prorated in the student
teaching semester if the student is registered for fewer than 12 credits.
Awards will not be awarded in conjunction with other institutional
beneﬁts such as employee tuition remission or the tuition exchange
program. The grant in combination with all other grants, scholarships,
and need-based loans will not exceed direct cost (e.g., tuition, fees, and
room/board for resident students and tuition and fees for commuting
students). Awards are available only during the regular academic year
(i.e., fall and spring semesters) and are not offered during the summer
term.
Science Majors
Grants are offered to ﬁrst-time, full-time students who are pursuing a
major within the School of Science. Candidates are identiﬁed by the
Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission; there is no separate application
process. The award is $4,000 per academic year and is renewable. To
renew students must maintain full-time status and a cumulative grade
point average of 3.0 or better, and must remain enrolled a science major.
The award may only be applied toward tuition assessed by Monmouth
University, and is applicable to costs associated with study abroad only
when tuition is assessed by Monmouth University. The award is also
available for Medical Laboratory Science or Clinical Laboratory Science
majors and will be prorated during the semester(s) in which course work
is not taken at Monmouth University; the award will be prorated by the
amount of the non-Monmouth tuition as a percentage of Monmouth
tuition. For education majors the award will be prorated in the student
teaching semester if the student is registered for fewer than 12 credits.
Awards will not be awarded in conjunction with other institutional
beneﬁts such as employee tuition remission or the tuition exchange
program. The grant in combination with all other grants, scholarships,
and need-based loans will not exceed direct cost (e.g., tuition, fees, and
room/board for resident students and tuition and fees for commuting
students). Awards are available only during the regular academic year
(i.e., fall and spring semesters) and are not offered during the summer
term.

SOAR Grants
Grants are awarded at the discretion of the Director of Undergraduate
Admission to incoming full-time undergraduate students and there is no
separate application process; award values are also determined by the
Director. The award is renewable provided that the student maintains fulltime enrollment status and a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or
better.
The award may only be applied toward tuition assessed by Monmouth
University, and is applicable to costs associated with study abroad only
when tuition is assessed by Monmouth University. The award is also
available for Medical Laboratory Science or Clinical Laboratory Science
majors and will be prorated during the semester(s) in which course work
is not taken at Monmouth University; the award will be prorated by the
amount of the non-Monmouth tuition as a percentage of Monmouth
tuition. For education majors the award will be prorated in the student
teaching semester if the student is registered for fewer than 12 credits.
Awards will not be awarded in conjunction with other institutional
beneﬁts such as employee tuition remission or the tuition exchange
program. The grant in combination with all other grants, scholarships,

University, and is applicable to costs associated with study abroad only
when tuition is assessed by Monmouth University. The award is also
available for Medical Laboratory Science or Clinical Laboratory Science
majors and will be prorated during the semester(s) in which course work
is not taken at Monmouth University; the award will be prorated by the
amount of the non-Monmouth tuition as a percentage of Monmouth
tuition. For education majors the award will be prorated in the student
teaching semester if the student is registered for fewer than 12 credits.
Awards will not be awarded in conjunction with other institutional
beneﬁts such as employee tuition remission or the tuition exchange
program. The grant in combination with all other grants, scholarships,
and need-based loans will not exceed direct cost (e.g., tuition, fees, and
room/board for resident students and tuition and fees for commuting
students). Awards are renewable provided the student maintains a
cumulative grade point average at Monmouth University of at least 3.0.

The Department of Athletics offers grants-in-aid, frequently called
athletics scholarships, to student-athletes who meet the eligibility
requirements set forth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) bylaws. These grants-in-aid are offered and renewed at the
discretion of the head coach with the consent and approval of the
Director of Athletics and the Director of Financial Aid and in accordance
with guidelines prescribed by Monmouth University and the NCAA.
Grants-in-aid are made for the academic year; funding for summer course
work is awarded at the discretion of the Director of Athletics. Student
athletes who receive an athletics scholarship must complete a Grant-InAid agreement, as prepared by the Department of Athletics.

University-Endowed and Sponsored Scholarships
The University offers a number of sponsored and endowed scholarships,
which have been made possible through the generosity of friends of
the University. All enrolled students automatically receive consideration
for these awards, and there is no student-initiated application process.
The Financial Aid Ofﬁce will identify a preliminary pool of candidates
for each scholarship, except where stipulated by the donor, and will
select the candidate who most closely matches the donor-established
criteria. Scholarship recipients will be notiﬁed via the Financial Aid Award
Letter. Where possible and as permitted by donor stipulated criteria,
the Financial Aid Ofﬁce will make every effort to renew the awards in
subsequent years.

Great Lawn Grant

of unmet ﬁnancial need (as deﬁned by the U.S. Department of Education)
and academic performance. All applicants for admission are given due
consideration, and recipients are selected by the Director of Financial Aid;
there is no separate application process for the grant.
The award may only be applied toward tuition assessed by Monmouth
University, and is applicable to costs associated with study abroad only
when tuition is assessed by Monmouth University. The award is also
available for Medical Laboratory Science or Clinical Laboratory Science
majors and will be prorated during the semester(s) in which course work
is not taken at Monmouth University; the award will be prorated by the
amount of the non-Monmouth tuition as a percentage of Monmouth
tuition. For education majors the award will be prorated in the student
teaching semester if the student is registered for fewer than 12 credits.
Awards will not be awarded in conjunction with other institutional
beneﬁts such as employee tuition remission or the tuition exchange

students). Awards are available only during the regular academic year
(i.e., fall and spring semesters) and are not offered during the summer
term. Awards are renewable provided the student maintains a cumulative
grade point average at Monmouth University of at least 2.5 and continues

Phi Theta Kappa Scholarship
Phi Theta Kappa is a national honor society for students at junior or
community colleges. A limited number of scholarships at Monmouth
University are available for students who are members of the society
at the time they enroll at Monmouth. The Ofﬁce of Undergraduate
Admission will identify and select the recipients; there is no separate

Yellow Ribbon
Monmouth University has voluntarily entered into a Yellow Ribbon
Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The agreement
is completed on an annual basis and includes the maximum number of
students to be funded, degree level of the recipients, and the maximum
contribution by the University. The University’s contribution is matched
by the VA. Students must be 100% eligible for Post-9/11 beneﬁts
to qualify for the Yellow Ribbon program. All interested students
must complete the University’s online Yellow Ribbon Application
(https://www.monmouth.edu/Yellow-Ribbon-Application.asp). Full-time
undergraduate students must submit an enrollment deposit before being
considered for the program, and part- time students must submit a parttime reply form to the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission. A Certiﬁcate
of Eligibility and DD-214 are required from all students at least two weeks
prior to the start of their ﬁrst semester. The University provides funding
for up to forty (40) students – both undergraduate and graduate. Awards
are made on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis, and students are notiﬁed
of their eligibility through an award letter. Students serving on active
duty are not eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program. Students in the
Yellow Ribbon Program are not eligible for other institutional grants
or scholarships. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity
Grant (FSEOG) and work study are only awarded to students living on
campus, provided that the student has remaining unmet need after the
Yellow Ribbon Grant and other VA beneﬁts are considered. Yellow Ribbon
recipients may receive the Pell Grant in addition to the beneﬁt. Students
are not issued refunds until the University receives payment from the VA.
For students attending a full academic year, Yellow Ribbon beneﬁts are
generally awarded in the spring semester after the Post-9/11 beneﬁts
have been exhausted. Awards are renewable, provided that the student
remains enrolled as a full-time student, and meets the established
standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress for federal and state
awards, and continues to meet VA-speciﬁed eligibility requirements.

Federal Pell Grant
The Federal Pell Grant ranges from $639 to $6,345 for the 2020-2021
academic year and is available to all undergraduate students, both fulland part-time, who have demonstrated extreme ﬁnancial need, as deﬁned
by the U.S. Department of Education; extreme ﬁnancial need is evaluated
using the completed FAFSA. Pell Grants are available during the regular
academic year (i.e., fall and spring semesters) and may be available
during the summer term, depending upon each student’s ﬁnancial aid
status during the academic year. Awards are renewable, provided that

Undergraduate 20-21

the student continues to demonstrate extreme ﬁnancial need and meets
the established standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress for federal
awards. Awards are applicable to costs associated with study abroad or
study at the Washington Center.

Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant
(FSEOG)
FSEOG is awarded to undergraduate students who demonstrate extreme
ﬁnancial need and is generally awarded to students who are Pell Grant
recipients. On average, Monmouth University awards $650 to FSEOG
recipients. Funding is limited, and priority is given to students who
have ﬁled their FAFSA in a timely fashion. FSEOG is available during
the regular academic year (i.e., fall and spring semesters) and may
be available during the summer term on a limited basis. Awards are
renewable, provided that the student continues to demonstrate extreme
ﬁnancial need and meets the established standards of Satisfactory
Academic Progress for federal awards. Awards are applicable to costs
associated with study abroad when the tuition is assessed by Monmouth
University or study at the Washington Center.

Federal TEACH Grant
The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education
(TEACH) Grant that provides grants of up to $4,000 per year (including the
summer term); students may receive a maximum of $16,000 in TEACH
Grant funding for undergraduate studies. In exchange for receiving a
TEACH Grant, the student must agree to serve as a full-time teacher
in a high-need ﬁeld (e.g., bilingual education and English language
acquisition, foreign language, mathematics, reading specialist, science,
special education, or other identiﬁed teacher shortage areas) in a public
or private elementary or secondary school that serves low-income
students. As a recipient of a TEACH Grant, the student must teach for at
least four academic years within eight calendar years of completing the
program of study for which the TEACH Grant was awarded.
IMPORTANT: If the student fails to complete this service obligation, all
TEACH Grants that the student received will be converted to a Direct
Unsubsidized Loan, with interest having accrued since the date the
TEACH grants were originally disbursed. The student must then repay
this loan to the U.S. Department of Education. Note: TEACH Grant
recipients will be given a six-month grace period prior to entering
repayment if a TEACH Grant is converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

Eligibility Requirements

To receive a TEACH Grant, the student must meet the following criteria:
• Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate
student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to
participate in the TEACH Grant Program;
• Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in
teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work
may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student
who intends to be a math teacher);
• Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring
above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining
a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25); and
• Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve, and complete an Entrance
Counseling session.

Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant
The Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant is for students whose parent or
guardian died as a result of military service in Iraq or Afghanistan. The
grant amount is equal to the maximum Federal Pell Grant for the award

41

year and cannot exceed cost of attendance. For the 2020-21 award year,
the maximum Federal Pell Grant is $6,345. Due to sequestration, awards
ﬁrst disbursed on or after October 1, 2020 and before October 1, 2021
must be reduced by 6.2 percent. This results in a maximum award of
$5,951.61.
Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) and meet the speciﬁc eligibility requirements below in order to
qualify for an Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant.
• You are not eligible for a Federal Pell Grant on the basis of your
Expected Family Contribution (EFC) but
• Meet the remaining Federal Pell Grant eligibility (https://
www.monmouth.edu/ﬁnaid/types/undergraduate/grants-andscholarships/federal-pell-grant/) requirements
• Your parent or guardian was a member of the U.S. armed forces and
died as a result of military service performed in Iraq or Afghanistan
after the events of 9/11, and
• You were under 24 years old or enrolled in college at least part-time at
the time of your parent’s or guardian’s death

New Jersey Tuition Aid Grant (TAG)
Students who are full-time undergraduates, have demonstrated ﬁnancial
need (as determined by the FAFSA), and have been New Jersey residents
for at least twelve consecutive months prior to the beginning of the
academic year may be eligible to receive the TAG grant. (Note that TAG
grants may be available under certain conditions for students in their
last semester who are part-time.) Final determinations of eligibility are
made by the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority
(NJHESAA); Monmouth University has no influence or control over a
student's determination of eligibility. For the 2019-20 academic year,
grant amounts ranged from $2,074 to $12,938. Grants are renewable
annually based upon continued ﬁnancial need and Satisfactory Academic
Progress, but will only be awarded for a maximum of nine semesters of
full-time undergraduate enrollment. Students who have not previously
received a TAG grant must apply by completing the FAFSA by September
15 for the fall and spring semesters and by February 15 for the spring
only. Prior TAG recipients must complete the FAFSA by April 15. TAG
grants are only available during the regular academic year (i.e., fall and
spring semesters). Awards are applicable to costs associated with study
abroad or study at the Washington Center.
The FAFSA serves as the primary application for TAG, but at the
conclusion of the FAFSA there is a supplemental application that
students must complete and submit NJHESAA. Students will be notiﬁed
of their eligibility by NJHESAA. Funding of this award is subject to
change due to annual State budget appropriations.

Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF) Grant
The undergraduate EOF program is designed to provide access to higher
education for New Jersey residents who might otherwise not have
the opportunity to obtain a college education. An applicant to the EOF
program must have been a legal resident of New Jersey for at least
twelve consecutive months prior to receipt of the grant, matriculate as
a full-time student, have an economic background that reflects a history
of poverty, and demonstrate the need for improvement of educational
basic skills. Parents of dependent students must also meet the New
Jersey residency requirement. Funding is, however, limited, and there
is a competitive application process. Once accepted into the program,
students receive additional academic, social, and ﬁnancial support;
both the state of New Jersey and the University provide grants to EOF
students. Students who believe they might qualify are encouraged to

42

Funding Sources

contact the University’s EOF Ofﬁce at 732-571-3462. Prospective EOF
students must complete the FAFSA before being considered for the
program, while currently enrolled EOF students must complete it by April
15. EOF funding is available during the regular academic year (i.e., fall
and spring semesters), and is available on a limited basis during the
summer term. In order to receive funding during the summer, students
must complete a summer ﬁnancial aid application. Requests for summer
funding are reviewed by the Director of the EOF program in conjunction
with the Assistant Director of Financial Aid, and are prioritized as follows:
1. students scheduled to graduate at the conclusion of the summer or
fall term;
2. science majors and
3. students who have changed majors.
All other requests will be fulﬁlled as funding permits. Academic
year awards are renewable, provided that the student continues to
demonstrate extreme ﬁnancial need, meets the established standards of
Satisfactory Academic Progress for state awards, and is in compliance
with the institutional requirements of the EOF program. Awards are
applicable to costs associated with study abroad, when tuition is
assessed by the University, or study at the Washington Center; approval
for off-campus study is at the discretion of the Director of the EOF
program and students may use Monmouth University EOF funding for
only one off-campus study experience.

New Jersey Survivor Tuition Beneﬁts Program
The Survivor Tuition Beneﬁts Program is for New Jersey residents who
attend Monmouth University on, at least, a half-time basis who are
spouses and/or dependents of emergency service personnel or law
enforcement ofﬁcers killed in the line of duty. Grants pay the actual
cost of tuition up to the highest tuition charged at a New Jersey public
institution of higher education. For the fall and spring terms, applications
must have been submitted by October 1; for Spring only awards, the
application must be submitted by March 1. Scholarship availability and
ﬁnding levels are determined by NJHESAA.

Law Enforcement Ofﬁcer Memorial Scholarship
The Law Enforcement Ofﬁcer Memorial Scholarship (LEOMS) beneﬁts
dependent children of New Jersey law enforcement ofﬁcers who were
killed in the line of duty. The scholarship is awarded up to the cost of
attendance less any other scholarships, grants, beneﬁts, and other
assistance awarded under the NJHESAA statute and may be renewed
for up to four years. Students must be U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens and enrolled on a full-time basis. The application deadline for
the fall and spring semesters is October 1, and for the spring only the
deadline is March 1. An application may be downloaded from the Higher

New Jersey Student Tuition Assistance Reward
Scholarship (STARS) II
The NJ STARS II Program is a continuation of the NJ STARS I Program.
NJ STARS I recipients who complete an Associate's Degree at any New
Jersey county college may transfer to a New Jersey four-year college/
university to earn a bachelor’s degree. NJ STARS II awards may only
be applied toward tuition, unless the student is also a Tuition Aid Grant

Loans
Direct Subsidized Loan
This is a federally funded loan program that is available to any
undergraduate student who has completed the FAFSA, demonstrated
ﬁnancial need, is a matriculated student enrolled for at least six credit
hours in one term, is a United States citizen or eligible non-citizen, has
maintained Satisfactory Academic progress, is not in default on a prior
student loan and has demonstrated ﬁnancial need; creditworthiness
is not a requirement for the Direct Subsidized Loan. The amount an
undergraduate student may borrow is dependent on class level and need:
• 0 - 28.5 credits completed - up to $3,500
• 29 - 56.5 credits completed - up to $4,500
• 57 or more credits completed - up to $5,500
The interest rate is ﬁxed at 2.75% for loans disbursed on or after July 1,
2020 and before June 30, 2021; the interest rate is ﬁxed for the life of the
loan. Interest does not accrue while the student is enrolled for at least six
credit hours. Borrowers are charged, by the federal government, an upfront origination fee. For loans disbursed on or after October 1, 2020 and
before October 1, 2021 the fee is 1.059%.

Direct Unsubsidized Loan
The Direct Unsubsidized Loan is a federally funded, low-interest-rate loan
with eligibility requirements, terms, and conditions similar to those of the
Direct Subsidized Loan. The primary difference is that interest accrues
on the loan immediately after it is disbursed and while the student is
enrolled. Students with no ﬁnancial need are permitted to borrow through
the Direct Unsubsidized loan program and may borrow between $3,500
and $5,500, depending upon class level:
• 0 - 28.5 credits completed - up to $3,500
• 29 - 56.5 credits completed - up to $4,500
• 57 or more credits completed - up to $5,500
Additionally, all undergraduate students, regardless of ﬁnancial need, are
eligible for $2,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds each academic year,
up to a maximum of $8,000.
Independent students (or dependent students whose parents are unable
to borrow a Federal Direct PLUS Loan) may also borrow additional
amounts under the Direct Unsubsidized Loan program, as follows:
• $4,000 per year for undergraduate students who have completed
fewer than ﬁfty-seven credits
• $5,000 per year for undergraduate students who have completed
more than ﬁfty-seven credits
Direct Unsubsidized Loans, in combination with other sources of ﬁnancial
aid, cannot exceed the student’s budgeted cost of attendance. The
interest rate is ﬁxed at 2.75% for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2020
and before July 1, 2020; the interest rate is ﬁxed for the life of the loan.
Interest does not accrue while the student is enrolled for at least six
credit hours. Borrowers are charged, by the federal government, an upfront origination fee. For loans disbursed on or after October 1, 2020 and
before October 1, 2021 the fee is 1.059%.

43

Students who have not previously borrowed a Direct Loan - either
Subsidized or Unsubsidized - at Monmouth University must complete
a promissory note; one promissory note will be used for both the
Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan programs. The Financial Aid
Ofﬁce will notify new borrowers when a promissory note is available
electronically for signature. Borrowers must complete the promissory
note and an Entrance Counseling (an online tutorial regarding the student
loan borrower's rights and responsibilities) session before the loan funds
will be credited electronically to the student’s account. The student
will begin repayment of all Direct Loans six months after graduation or
cessation of at least half-time enrollment. Direct Loans are available
during the regular academic year (i.e., fall and spring semesters) and
may be available during the summer term, depending upon the student’s
borrowing during the academic year; to access loan funds during the
summer term, students must complete the University’s Summer Financial
Aid Application and be registered for at least six credits during the course
of the summer. In order to receive Direct Loan funding in subsequent
academic years, the student must meet the established standards
of Satisfactory Academic Progress for federal awards. Direct Loans
are applicable to costs associated with study abroad or study at the
Washington Center.

Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate
Students (PLUS)
This is a federally funded loan program. Parents of eligible dependent
undergraduate students (i.e., the student is enrolled as a matriculated
student in at least six credits, is U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, has
maintained Satisfactory Academic Progress, has completed the FAFSA,
and is not in default on a prior student loan) may apply for this loan; the
parent must also meet general eligibility criteria (i.e., the parent must
be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen and must not be in default on a
prior student loan). The PLUS loan is not based on ﬁnancial need, but
borrowers must demonstrate creditworthiness. Eligible borrowers may
borrow the difference between the cost of attending Monmouth and any
other ﬁnancial aid the student receives.
The interest rate is ﬁxed at 5.30% for loans disbursed on or after July 1,
2020 and before July 1, 2021; the interest rate is ﬁxed for the life of the
loan. Interest does not accrue while the student is enrolled for at least six
credit hours. Borrowers are charged, by the federal government, an upfront origination fee. For loans disbursed on or after October 1, 2020 and
before October 1, 2021 the fee is 4.236%. Interest begins to accrue on the
loan once it is disbursed and, unless the parent borrower requests an inschool deferment, the ﬁrst payment is due sixty days after the loan is fully
disbursed. Repayment lasts between ten and twenty-ﬁve years based
on the total amount borrowed and the repayment option chosen by the
borrower.
The parent borrower must complete the application and promissory note
online (https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action/). Shortly
after the beginning of each term, the University’s Financial Aid Ofﬁce will
electronically transmit the funds to the student’s account.
Direct PLUS Loans are available during the regular academic year (i.e.,
fall and spring semesters) and the summer term; to access loan funds
during the summer term, students must complete the University’s
Summer Financial Aid Application and must be registered for at least
six credits during the summer. In order to receive Direct Loan funding
in subsequent academic years, the student must meet the established
standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress for federal awards. PLUS

loans are applicable to costs associated with study abroad or study at
the Washington Center.

Perkins Loan
Effective September 30, 2017, the federal government discontinued this
loan program.

Monmouth University Loan Fund
This loan program is funded by Monmouth University. Awards are
made at the discretion of the Director of Financial Aid and are not
renewable; the amount of the award is also at the discretion of the
Director. Monmouth University Loan Funds may not be applied to costs
associated with off-campus study (e.g., study abroad or study at the
Washington Center). The terms and conditions of the loan are as follows:
• Interest on the loan is ﬁxed at 7 percent for the life of the loan and
begins to accrue nine (9) months after the student ceases at least
half-time (i.e., six credits) enrollment. When the student ceases halftime enrollment, he or she enters repayment.
• While in repayment, the student is expected to make quarterly
payments of principle and interest of at least $120, although a
minimum annual payment of 10% of the principle is required.
• The maximum repayment term is ten (10) years and there is no
penalty for prepayment.
• In order to accept the offer of a Monmouth University Loan, students
must complete a promissory note and disclosure documents as
prepared by the Financial Aid Ofﬁce.

Alternative Loans
Alternative ﬁnancing sources are available from private lenders and are a
ﬁnancing option for students who either do not meet the eligibility criteria
for the Direct Loan programs, or who have exceeded the borrowing
limits for those programs. Generally, students may apply for a loan of
up to the cost of education, as determined by the Financial Aid Ofﬁce,
less any other aid. Alternative loans are not regulated by the federal
government, and the terms and conditions of the loans may vary widely
among lenders and, as such, students are encourage to carefully evaluate
alternative loan options. Once you have chosen a lender, complete their
recommended application process. The Financial Aid Ofﬁce will then
certify the loan, and once the semester begins, funds will be forwarded to
the University and credited to the student’s account.
Although alternative loans are generally not regulated by the U.S.
Department of Education, the University is required to publish a Code of
Conduct (http://catalog.monmouth.edu/graduate-catalog/ﬁnancial-aid/
loans/Code_of_Conduct.pdf) regarding loans.

Employment
Federal Work Study for Undergraduate
Students
This federally funded program provides part-time employment, both onand off-campus, in a variety of settings to eligible students. Students are
compensated at a competitive wage, dependent upon the skills required
to perform the assigned tasks, and may work between ﬁve and twenty
hours per week during the academic year. Students are paid by check biweekly; work study earnings are not credited to the student’s account.

Eligibility and award amounts are based upon demonstrated ﬁnancial
need, in the context of the total amount of ﬁnancial aid received by the
student from all other sources. To be considered for the Federal Work
Study program, the student must have ﬁled the FAFSA and meet all
eligibility requirements for federal funding. Funding is limited, and priority
is given to students who have ﬁled their ﬁnancial aid application in a
timely fashion. The average annual work study award made to students
is $2,000 and inclusion of Federal Work Study in a student's ﬁnancial aid
package is not a guarantee of employment.

On-Campus Employment
The University offers a limited number of part-time, on-campus jobs
to students not eligible for Federal Work Study and commonly known
as "student help"; to be considered for these positions, students must
complete the FAFSA and demonstrate that they are ineligible for Federal
Work Study. Students are compensated at a competitive wage, dependent
upon the skills required to perform the assigned tasks. Generally,
students in this non-need-based employment program are limited to a
maximum number of twenty hours per week.
For more information on employment, please call the Student
Employment Ofﬁce at 732-263-5706.

Satisfactory Academic Progress
Federal regulations require institutions to establish minimum standards
of satisfactory academic progress for students receiving federal funding
(i.e., Pell Grant, SEOG grant, Direct Loans, TEACH Grant, and Work
Study); the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority
(NJHESAA) requires that recipients of NJ grants and scholarships (i.e.,
TAG, EOF, Urban Scholarship, NJCLASS loan) meet these requirements as
well.
Satisfactory academic progress for federal and state funding at
Monmouth University is measured along three dimensions: cumulative
grade point average, pace, and maximum time frame. All course work
is considered in the evaluation of a student's academic progress,
whether or not the student received ﬁnancial aid at the time the work was
completed.
To remain in good standing, a student must meet each of the three
requirements:
• Cumulative Grade Point Average: Consistent with the general
academic requirements of the University, students must meet the
following grade point average requirements to retain their eligibility
for ﬁnancial aid:
Year

Credits

Freshmen

1.60

Sophomores

2.00

Juniors

2.00

Seniors

2.00

Please refer to Academic Deﬁnitions of freshman, sophomore, junior, and
senior class standing.
Note: Students must have earned a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or better by the
end of their second academic year of enrollment, regardless of whether or not
they have completed enough credits to attain junior class standing.
• Pace: All students must successfully complete at least 67 percent
of the credit hours for which they enroll/attempt. Note that repeated

Undergraduate 20-21

courses and course work assigned grades of “W,” “F,” or “I” will not be
counted as credits completed toward graduation but will be counted
as attempted credits. Course work taken at the developmental
level (i.e., courses numbered “050”) will also be counted as credits
attempted and, if completed, as credits completed. These factors
should be kept in mind when planning a class schedule. Students
receiving credit for courses transferred from another institution will
have those credits counted as both attempted and completed credits
in the evaluation of Satisfactory Academic Progress.
• Maximum Time Frame: Students must also meet the maximum time
frame component of satisfactory academic progress. The maximum
number of credits an undergraduate student may attempt and receive
funding for is 180. This ﬁgure is 150 percent of the published number
of credits (120) required to complete an undergraduate degree
program.
Those students who receive scholarship or grant funding from Monmouth
University must also meet certain standards for cumulative grade point
average as follows:

45

immediate family, a death in the immediate family, or divorce. Supporting
documentation of the circumstances forming the basis for the student’s
appeal must be submitted with the appeal. Students who have been
deemed ineligible in a prior semester, but who have since improved their
performance to the required level, are also encouraged to submit an
appeal for the reinstatement of their aid; the student’s ﬁnancial aid will
not be automatically reinstated.

Return of Financial Aid When a
Student Withdraws
The federal government mandates that students who withdraw from all
classes may only keep the ﬁnancial aid they have "earned" up to the time
of withdrawal. Funds that have been disbursed in excess of the earned
amount must be returned by the University and/or the student to the
source of the aid (i.e., the federal government, the state government,
or the University). A withdrawn student could owe aid funds to the
University, the government, or both.

• Each sponsored or endowed scholarship may require unique criteria
for renewal, and recipients will be advised of those criteria.

A student is considered to have ofﬁcially withdrawn when he or she
notiﬁes the University of his or her intent to withdraw from all classes.
The date of the ofﬁcial notice will be used to calculate the amount
of ﬁnancial aid to be returned; in the absence of an ofﬁcial notice of
withdrawal, the student's last date of attendance at an academically
related activity will be conﬁrmed with the faculty; the last date of
attendance at an academically related activity will also be conﬁrmed for a
student who has not ofﬁcially withdrawn and who receives a combination
of all "F" and/or “W” grades at the end of the semester. The earlier of
the ofﬁcial date of withdrawal or the last date of attendance will be used
for calculating the amount of ﬁnancial aid to be returned to the source.
Please refer to the section entitled Course Withdrawals for withdrawal
policies and procedures.

Financial aid at Monmouth University is awarded to students for the
entire academic year or summer session. Academic progress for all
aid recipients is reviewed at the conclusion of the spring semester. If a
student has not met all of the requisite standards, the student will be
ineligible to receive federal, state, and/or institutional funds. Students
who are deemed ineligible will be offered the opportunity to submit an
appeal for reinstatement of their aid eligibility; refer to the section below
for the Appeals procedure. (Please note that submission of an appeal for
reinstatement of ﬁnancial aid does not constitute an appeal for academic
reinstatement to the University.)

To determine the amount of aid the student has earned up to the time
of withdrawal (either ofﬁcial or unofﬁcial), the Financial Aid Ofﬁce
divides the number of calendar days the student has attended classes
by the total number of calendar days in the semester (minus any
scheduled breaks of ﬁve days or more). The resulting percentage is then
multiplied by the total federal funds that were disbursed for the semester;
institutional funds, state funds, and alternative loans will be prorated in
the same manner. (Note that if the student remains enrolled and attends
class beyond the 60% point of the semester in which aid is received, all
aid is considered earned and not subject to a refund calculation.)

• Monmouth Academic Excellence Scholarship (3.0)
• Monmouth Academic Grant (2.5)
• Monmouth Incentive Grant (2.0)
• Shadow Lawn Grant Out of State (3.0)
• Shadow Lawn Science Grant (3.5)
• Transfer Science Scholarship (3.0)
• Science Achievement Scholarship (3.0)
• Great Lawn Grant (2.5)
• SOAR Grant (2.5)

Appeals Process
When a student is deemed ineligible for ﬁnancial aid, the student will
be provided with written notiﬁcation of ineligibility. The student will
have the opportunity to submit a written appeal for review. All such
appeals should be forwarded to the Associate Director of Financial Aid.
The Associate Director will review the appeal and may elect to return
the student to good standing, continue the student’s ﬁnancial aid for a
probationary period, reduce the student’s ﬁnancial aid award, or uphold
the determination of ineligibility (i.e., cancel the student’s ﬁnancial aid).
Students submitting an appeal will be provided written notiﬁcation of the
outcome of their appeal.
Generally, only appeals that involve documented circumstances beyond
the student’s control which have had an impact upon the student’s
academic performance will be considered. Circumstances which
might merit an appeal include, but are not limited to, the following:
serious illness or injury to the student or a member of the student’s

This calculation determines the amount of aid earned by the student that
he or she may keep (for example, if the student attended 25% of the term,
the student will have earned 25% of the aid disbursed). The unearned
amount (total aid disbursed minus the earned amount) must be returned
to the source by the University and/or the student. The Financial Aid
Ofﬁce will notify and provide instructions to students who are required to
return funds.
Funds that are returned to the federal government are used to reimburse
the individual federal programs from which the student received the aid.
Financial aid returned (by the University and/or the student or parent)
must be allocated, in the following order, up to the net amount disbursed
from each source:
1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan
2. Federal Direct Subsidized Loan
3. Federal Direct PLUS (Parent) Loan
4. Federal Pell Grant

46

Return of Financial Aid When a Student Withdraws

5. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)
6. Other Federal Loan or Grant Assistance
It is also possible that the student may have “earned” the aid, but
it was not yet disbursed to the student’s account. Post-withdrawal
disbursement occurs when the student receives less federal student
aid than the amount earned (based on withdrawal date). The Financial
Aid Ofﬁce will determine if the student is entitled to a post-withdrawal
disbursement and will then offer, in writing, a disbursement of the earned
aid that was not received. All post-withdrawal disbursement offers will
be made within thirty days of the date the University determined that
the student withdrew. The student must accept the post-withdrawal
disbursement in writing and within fourteen days from the date that the
University sends the notiﬁcation that the student is eligible to receive
the post-withdrawal disbursement. If the student does not respond to
the University’s notice, no post-withdrawal disbursement will be made
and the aid will be cancelled. The student may accept or decline some
or all of the post-withdrawal disbursement. Accepted post-withdrawal
disbursements will be made from aid programs in the following order:
1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan
2. Federal Direct Subsidized Loan
3. Federal Direct PLUS (Parent) Loan
4. Federal Pell Grant
5. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)
6. Other Federal Loan or Grant Assistance
Students whose circumstances require that they withdraw from all
classes are strongly encouraged to contact the Financial Aid Ofﬁce and
their academic advisor before doing so. At that time, the consequences
of withdrawing from all classes can be explained and clearly illustrated.
Financial aid counselors can provide refund examples and further explain
this policy to students and parents.
Students who withdraw from the University may also be entitled to
a refund of a portion of their tuition, fees, and room/board charges,
dependent upon the point in time at which the student withdraws. See
Refund Policy for detailed information on the University’s tuition, fee, and
room/board refund policies.

Double-Dipping Requirements in the General Education Curriculum:
Content Area Courses (Mathematics, Natural Sciences (NS), Literature
(LIT), World Languages, Aesthetics and Creativity (AT), Historical
Perspectives (HS.SV) and Social Science Survey (SS.SV) may carry
one additional general education course designation. However, these
courses may not be double-dipped with another content area course.
World Language courses are prohibited from being double-dipped with
courses that carry a Cultural Diversity (CD) or Global Understanding (GU)
course code.
Interdisciplinary Courses (Technological Literacy (TL), Reasoned Oral
Discourse (RD), Cultural Diversity (CD), Global Understanding (GU), and
Experiential Education (EX) may be fulﬁlled with a stand-alone course
that carries the course code, in a course that carries two Interdisciplinary
Course Codes, or in a Content Area course that carries an Interdisciplinary
Course code. No course can carry both a Cultural Diversity (CD) and a Global
Understanding (GU) course code.
Writing Intensive Courses (WT) must be fulﬁlled in courses within a
student’s major and therefore could be fulﬁlled either in a stand-alone
course that carries the course code, in a course that carries a Content
Area general education designation that also fulﬁlls a requirement in a
student’s major, or in a course that carries an Interdisciplinary general
education designation and also fulﬁlls a requirement in a student’s major.
No course will be permitted to carry more than two general education
course designations. This restriction includes the Writing Intensive (WT)
courses.

Rationale
The Purpose of the General Education
Requirements at Monmouth University
The purpose of Monmouth University’s General Education curriculum is
to multiply the intellectual vistas that the student has considered. The
curriculum is designed to be a transformative learning experience that
inspires intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and personal growth.
In pursuit of this purpose, the Faculty of Monmouth University has
developed a curriculum that draws upon multiple disciplines and
perspectives to create an academic experience with a strong emphasis
on the liberal arts.

Reading and Writing (EN-101 & EN-102)
The First Year Composition sequence prepares students in the conventions,
style, and substance of general academic writing while also teaching
basic research and documentation skills. Additionally, through exposure
to a variety of texts and genres in these courses, students learn to
be more discerning and critical readers. Students can apply these
experiences and skills to all subsequent coursework.

Mathematics (MA)
Mathematics courses give students opportunities to better understand
the quantitative nature of the world and develop logical methods to solve
problems in a variety of disciplines. Students taking these courses will
learn ways that mathematics can play a role in their academic experience
as well as in their lives beyond the campus.

Natural Sciences (NS)
Natural Science courses provide students with understanding of and
appreciation for the process and practice of science, while at the same
time offering instruction in areas of particular scientiﬁc interest. This
knowledge will inform their reactions to critical public, professional and
personal issues.

Literature (LIT)
Through reading and writing analytically about major literary texts,
students in Literature courses develop an understanding of the
key characteristics in a literary genre. They also learn how these
characteristics reflect ethical and cultural concerns across national and
class differences.

Aesthetics and Creativity (AT)
Aesthetics and Creativity courses provide students with an understanding
of and appreciation for the arts, offering instruction in the speciﬁc areas
of art, dance, music, and theatre. Through exposure to live performances
and exhibits, students learn to view and critique artistic endeavors in an
informed and articulate manner.

Technological Literacy (TL)
Technological Literacy courses provide students with knowledge and
experience that prepares them to ethically and effectively use current and
future technology in their personal, civic, educational and professional
lives.

Reasoned Oral Discourse (RD)
Students in Reasoned Oral Discourse courses learn to develop and deliver
persuasive and effective oral presentations, and to critically evaluate the
presentations of others.

Historical Perspective (HS.SV)
History is our collective memory as a society—indeed, history is the
foundation of the society we live in today. It provides a rich body of
examples for understanding the challenges of daily life, and is an
excellent guide for public action. History survey courses help students
understand the world in which they live through an examination of the
broad patterns of the human past, as reflected in written documents,
physical artifacts, and oral traditions.

Social Sciences (SS.SV)
Social Science survey courses explore why people think, feel and act
the way they do, through the study of anthropology, economics, gender
studies, geography (including geographic information systems or GIS),
political science, psychology, or sociology. Students explore scientiﬁc
avenues for understanding the human experience by studying the
theoretical underpinnings, major concepts, and methodologies of the
social sciences.

Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the
Human Experience (ISP)
Interdisciplinary Perspectives courses enable students to synthesize
knowledge from many subject areas to forge coherent and ethical
responses to contemporary issues and problems. These courses are

Undergraduate 20-21

taken by students in their senior year and they serve as a capstone
learning experience in students’ intellectual lives within the university.

Cultural Diversity (CD)
Cultural Diversity courses challenge students to recognize differences
between people — based on race, ethnicity (ethnic identity), class
(economics), gender, sexual orientation, disability, and religion — that
affect the lives of individuals, communities, societies, nations, and world
regions. Students learn how these differences influence hierarchies of
power that exist in our world today. Understanding these differences is
essential for students to become engaged citizens in this diverse world.

Global Understanding (GU)
Students in Global Understanding courses explore individual and collective
responsibilities through analytical, practical, or creative responses to
issues facing a global interconnected society. Students’ understanding
of interconnectedness, difference, and diversity enables them to interact
effectively in cultures other than their own.

World Language (WL)
World Language courses provide students with the skills to become
marketable global citizens through the study of language within the
cultural context in which the language occurs. The curriculum is designed
to focus on communication, culture, connections, comparisons, and
communities in order to equip students for success in a pluralistic
American society and abroad.

Most First Year Seminar classes have a student Peer Learning Assistant
(PLA). Acting as a mentor/role model and assistant to the professor,
the PLA helps with the adjustment, learning and self-exploration most
students experience in their ﬁrst semester. PLA positions are paid and
applications can be found on the First Year Seminar Web site.
First Year Seminar is a requirement for all ﬁrst-year students entering
Monmouth University with eighteen (18) credits or fewer and must be
taken during the student’s ﬁrst semester at Monmouth.
Additional information may be found on the First Year Seminar Web
site (http://www.monmouth.edu/FYSeminar/) or write to the First Year
Seminar (fyseminar@monmouth.edu).

Experiential Education Requirements
Experiential Education courses allow students to connect what they have
learned in the classroom to external experiences, such as internships
(paid or unpaid), research opportunities, service learning projects,
or study abroad. Through these experiences students gain deeper
understanding and develop ﬁeld-related competencies. They are able
to explore possible future careers and lifestyles while considering local
and global options, discover and understand other cultures, reflect upon
personal and professional development, and relate their experience to life
after Monmouth.
Examples of ways a student could complete the ExEd requirement
include the following:

Experiential Education (EX)

• Internships (including practicums, ﬁeldwork, and student teaching)

Experiential Education courses allow students to connect what they have
learned in the classroom to external experiences, such as internships
(paid or unpaid), research opportunities, service learning projects,
or study abroad. Through these experiences students gain deeper
understanding and develop ﬁeld-related competencies. They are able
to explore possible future careers and lifestyles while considering local
and global options, discover and understand other cultures, reflect upon
personal and professional development and relate their experience to life
after Monmouth.

• Research

Writing-Intensive Courses Within the
Major (WT)
The primary goal of Writing Intensive courses is to provide Monmouth
students with opportunities to practice writing beyond the ﬁrst-year
composition sequence. As a skill that is necessary for both academic and
life success, writing mastery requires constant practice, varying based on
audience, context, and purpose.

First Year Seminar
First Year Seminar is a three-credit academic course designed to help
new students make a successful transition into the intellectual life of
Monmouth University. The courses are taught on a variety of subjects by
full-time professors from all academic disciplines, who engage students
in scholarly inquiry within their areas of interest and expertise. Within
the courses, students sharpen higher-level academic skills, study ethical
issues related to both course topic and to academic life, and learn about
Monmouth resources and opportunities. Students also gain experience in
critical analysis of information and hone their research and collaborative
problem-solving skills.

51

• Service Learning
• Study Abroad
• ExEd designated courses
Students who wish to learn more about Experiential Education and
explore career and service learning opportunities, potential courses,
and placement options in each academic discipline are encouraged to
visit the program’s Web site. Experiential Education courses are listed
in the Catalog, designated with course type "ExEd", in the “Registration”
section of WebAdvisor for students under "Sections Offered by Term
(Search for Classes), and on the program’s interactive Web site (http://
www.monmouth.edu/exed/).
Students must consult their faculty advisors to learn more about
the speciﬁc ways in which the ExEd requirement is completed in
their respective disciplines, to plan for meaningful work and service
experiences that are relevant to their personal and career goals, and to
follow the process for applying for ExEd credit. When students plan for
an internship practicum, service learning, or corporate project they must
complete ﬁfty (50) hours for every one credit of experiential course work.
Beyond satisfying the ExEd requirement, students are encouraged to
explore additional experiential learning opportunities that foster critical
thinking and that emphasize the application of real-world knowledge and
skills.
Nontraditional students who have returned to school after gaining
experience in the work world should inquire about the Experiential
Education Portfolio Policy. Work experience that can be documented
(including military service) can serve as credit for the ExEd requirement.

52

Dual Majors

To further explore internship and service learning opportunities, students
should contact Career Services, located in the lower level of the Rebecca
Stafford Student Center.
To learn more about Study Abroad, students should contact the Global
Education Ofﬁce, located in Room 29 of the Rebecca Stafford Student
Center.

Experiential Education Portfolio Policy
The portfolio process was designed for the nontraditional student who
has returned to school after experience in the work world that can be
documented (including military service) and serve as credit for the
experiential education requirement within his or her major. Students who
wish to submit a portfolio package for consideration in fulﬁllment of the
Experiential Education general education requirement must produce a
body of ofﬁcial documentation, which is outlined below.
1. The departmental chairperson should initiate a memo to which all
copies of the documentation from the student are attached. Chairs
should indicate their agreement or reservations for approval and
then forward the package to the chair of the Experiential Education
Committee. The documentation must include:
a. resume;
b. a minimum 3-5-page academic piece, such as a short research
paper or reflection journal on past learning activities, if the
student did not carry out the internship/service learning activity
for academic credit or under faculty supervision (from any postsecondary institution);

Faculty may request that a travel class be considered as an experiential
education class if the course meets the following guidelines:
1. Students will engage in a learning project, prearranged with a
supervisor at the destination (not the faculty member) for a minimum
of ﬁfty (50) hours/one (1) credit.
2. Students will produce a daily log, reflective essay, and an external
evaluation from their supervisor while at the destination.
3. The course will comply with all other Experiential Education
requirements regarding percentage of assignments and number of
hours, etc.
4. If faculty offers the class for some students as Experiential Education
and some without Experiential Education credit, classes can be crosslisted as such on a case-by-case basis.

Dual Majors
Students wishing to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of two
degree programs should observe the following guidelines:
• The “Change Program Major” e-FORM should be used to declare
intent of satisfying the requirements of two degree programs.
• The ofﬁcial curriculum for each degree program is the curriculum in
effect at the time of declaring that particular degree program.
• The student is responsible for coordinating the course requirements
of the two curricula and should seek appropriate advising in both
departments.

d. company/organization letters that verify work experience for
which the student is trying to get credit;

• The student will receive one diploma stating both major programs
if each program is associated with the same degree; if the degrees
are different, two diplomas will be issued. The fact of the dual majors
should be declared before the time of the application for graduation.

e. brief statement that outlines the time frame, circumstances, and
manner under which the experience occurred;

• A student's major must contain eighteen (18) or more credits distinct
for each degree program and any additional programs (e.g., a minor)

f. Individual departments have the option to add additional
requirements to this procedure.

• Students following dual programs must complete both programs to
graduate.

c. academic transcript;

2. After receiving and assessing such work, the chair will send the
Dean’s Ofﬁce the completed academic piece and the student’s
portfolio; the Dean’s Ofﬁce will then forward this information to the
Experiential Education Committee for ﬁnal approval. After all of the
appropriate signatures have been obtained, the memo will then be
forwarded to the Registrar for appropriate accreditation.
Students must demonstrate through a detailed dossier a substantial
background of career or community service experience related to their
chosen program of study. While each department will determine the
guidelines for portfolio experience, it is recommended that students have
engaged in a particular career or community service activity for at least
four consecutive years.
All portfolio dossiers must be reviewed and receive initial approval by the
department chairperson and school dean before they are forwarded to
the chair of the Experiential Education Committee.
Students cannot exercise the portfolio option if the department of their
chosen academic studies requires certain Experiential Education courses
as part of their major.

Experiential Education Travel Class Policy
A travel class is deﬁned as any trip taken with a faculty member to be
exposed to learning opportunities out of the classroom.

Minors
Minor programs are designed to let students pursue a guided course
of study in an area outside their major. Minors normally require at least
one-half the number of credits of the major. Courses transferred into
Monmouth University may apply toward the minor, but at least nine
credits must be earned at Monmouth University. A 2.10 minimum grade
point average is required in the minor.
Once a student declares a minor, his or her academic program will be
modiﬁed to include the minor. The Registrar will record the minor on the
student’s transcript only after the student has completed the minor and
has satisﬁed all requirements for the appropriate baccalaureate degree.
Students with a declared but incomplete minor at the time of completion
of their major will not graduate unless written notice is received by the
Ofﬁce of the Registrar to delete the minor. The written notice must be
received no later than ten (10) days prior to graduation.
Students cannot minor and major in the same discipline. A student's
minor must contain nine (9) or more credits distinct from the student's
major requirements and any additional programs (e.g., a second minor).
This does not include interdisciplinary requirements of a student's major,
which may be applied to the student's minor in another discipline. Credits
required as part of a concentration are not considered distinct credits.

Undergraduate 20-21

Other restrictions might apply. To review Minor program requirements
please navigate to the applicable departmental page in this catalog.

Second Baccalaureate Degree
Monmouth University graduates with a baccalaureate degree desiring
to return to Monmouth University for an additional baccalaureate
degree must satisfy, by taking additional courses, a minimum of thirty
(30) additional credits of the curriculum requirements in effect at time
of readmission and declaration of the major. Any student who has
completed a degree program at Monmouth University will be considered
to have met the residency requirement, but transfer credits taken
subsequent to the ﬁrst degree program may not be applied toward the
second baccalaureate degree.
Students with baccalaureate degrees from other institutions who wish
to enter Monmouth to receive a second baccalaureate degree will be
accepted on a case-by-case basis and must satisfy the existing policy for
transfer students. Please see the Admission section of this catalog for
more details. Students may not pursue a second baccalaureate degree
in the same major. Students requesting second baccalaureate degrees in
a major where a graduate degree exists will likely be denied acceptance
into the second baccalaureate degree upon School/department review.
If an application for a second baccalaureate is considered, only credits
relevant to the second baccalaureate degree will be evaluated for
designated course credit; all other credits will be designated as free
electives. Students enrolling for a second baccalaureate must satisfy
all Monmouth general education requirements. A minimum of thirty
(30) curriculum credits must be completed to receive a baccalaureate
degree. Additional credits may be necessary in order to satisfy curriculum
requirements in the second baccalaureate.

The Honors School

Study Abroad

Dean: Nancy Mezey, Ph.D.

Monmouth University encourages students to add an international
dimension to their undergraduate education by studying abroad. Qualiﬁed
students can participate in study abroad either through the Monmouth
University semester and summer programs in London, Sydney, Cádiz,
Strasbourg, Buenos Aires, Sorrento, and Florence; through shortterm study abroad programs led by Monmouth University faculty; or
through any program offered by an approved or accredited U.S. institution
of higher education. Students who plan to study abroad in a program
other than one sponsored by Monmouth University cannot enroll through
another school or consortium when that program is offered through
Monmouth University.

The Honors School offers a program for high-achieving and highly
motivated students to participate in a supportive living-learning
community that provides enhanced curricular and co-curricular
experiences. This program fosters enthusiasm for intellectual inquiry
as a lifelong process and incorporates interdisciplinary approaches to
education to encourage the intellectual and ethical growth necessary for
a successful college and post-college life.
Honors students work closely with faculty mentors as they pursue
scholarly research, writing, and dissemination. They complete twentyﬁve honors credits, twelve at the lower level in general education and
thirteen at the upper level, often in their major. Students fulﬁll their
twelve general education credits by taking sections designated for
honors students. Limited in size to no more than twenty students, these
honors classes promote faculty and student rapport and participation.
Many courses such as in English, History, Anthropology, Psychology,
Sociology, Art, and Music, are "clustered" together by a cohesive theme
that encourages seeing the connections among different ﬁelds of study,
thereby encouraging an integrative approach to learning. Students in
the cluster take these courses together, further fostering friendship and
collaborative learning. For students whose strengths lie in Math and
Sciences, we also offer honors sections at the lower level.
At the upper level, students complete twelve (12) credits of honors
courses in the major or other ﬁeld of study, culminating in the Honors
Thesis/Capstone. The capstone thesis or project is completed as
a tutorial, with the close support and academic guidance of faculty
mentors. The Honors School also offers students the opportunity to
be considered for the prestigious Freed Award for the best completed
Honors Thesis/Capstone, as well as the William P. Mitchell Award for the
Dr. William P. Mitchell Excellence in Honors Award for outstanding service
to the Honors School.
In addition to the academic curriculum, the Monmouth University Honors
experience is enriched by numerous social, cultural, and academic coand extracurricular activities, including participation in the Peer Mentor
Program and the Honors School Association. Honors students can fully
immerse in a living-learning community by opting to house in Beechwood
Residence Hall. Regardless of where they live, all Honors students can
take advantage of Beechwood's main floor study lounge and lower level
social lounge. Honors students who commute can park in designated
parking spots behind Beechwood. These combined features make
Beechwood Residence Hall a unique living-learning experience for Honors
students to foster academic, social, and professional relationships with
their peers as they live, relax, study, attend classes, and grow together.
Honors students also enjoy enhanced opportunities after graduation. In
addition to gainful employment, more than 50 percent of Honors School
students go on to pursue graduate and professional degree programs.
Graduation from the Honors school is noted on the student's transcript
and diploma. Best of all, Honors School students know that they have
completed a program that encourages serious intellectual exploration in
a supportive environment.

B.A. or B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies
Please contact the Honors School to discuss the available options for
these programs.

Study abroad at any one of Monmouth’s programs or through other
approved programs will satisfy the experiential education component
of the general education requirements provided that a minimum of six
credits are successfully completed.
Students wishing to study abroad must meet the following qualiﬁcations:
1. At least sophomore status.
2. A minimum GPA of 2.75.
3. Not be on judicial probation.
4. Not be on academic probation.
Students must meet these criteria at the time of application and
immediately prior to studying abroad. Failure to do so will result in the
student’s removal from the study abroad program.

Monmouth University Study Abroad
in London, Sydney, Cádiz, Strasbourg,
Buenos Aires, Sorrento, or Florence
Tuition for the Monmouth study abroad programs is charged at the same
rate as on-campus tuition. All merit awards and scholarships apply,
except for athletic scholarships and tuition remission. Students attending
the Monmouth programs will have all grades listed on their transcript
and they will also be calculated into their grade point average (G.P.A.).
Institutional credit will be granted for all earned grades.
Students considering this opportunity should consult the Global
Education Ofﬁce staff on the ﬁrst floor of the Rebecca Stafford Student
Center or by emailing the Global Education Ofﬁce (GEO@monmouth.edu)
with your questions. More information and application instructions
can be found on the Monmouth Global Programs (https://monmouthsa.terradotta.com/) website.

Non-Monmouth Study Abroad Programs
Students who choose the option of studying abroad under the auspices
of other accredited programs must meet the study abroad criteria
speciﬁed above, complete the Monmouth University study abroad
application on the Global Education Ofﬁce's section of the Portal, and
follow the guidelines as provided on the “Study Abroad – non-Monmouth
Program” form available from e-FORMS. The e-FORM will be electronically
routed for approvals, with an e-mail conﬁrmation when all approvals have
been obtained.

56

The Washington Center

The Washington Center
Monmouth University is afﬁliated with the Washington Center that
provides semester and summer internship programs in Washington,
DC, for all majors. Internships in the capital that combine on-the-job
experience with academic study are available in the White House,
Congress, the courts, cabinet-level agencies, think tanks, professional
and trade associations, print and electronic media, ﬁnancial institutions,
law ﬁrms, with lobbyists, high-tech industries, museums, theaters,
advertising agencies, and market research ﬁrms. The Monmouth
University liaison to the Washington Center is Dr. Joseph Patten, Political
Science Department, Bey Hall.
An internship course number will be assigned for use by any department
wishing to place interns. Speciﬁc application of credits to degree
requirements will be approved by the department chair and school dean
in advance of enrolling. Students register for ﬁfteen credits: twelve for the
internship and three for the academic course. Students who successfully
complete the Washington Center Program automatically satisfy the
experiential education requirement.

Accelerated Programs
In several programs a student may complete requirements for a
baccalaureate degree within three calendar years. Students who are
considering such an accelerated program should consult with advisors to
plan their course sequences carefully.

Certiﬁcate Programs
Certiﬁcate programs offer students an opportunity to obtain a
concentrated education in a specialized area. Students who successfully
complete the stated requirements and have a minimum G.P.A. of 2.10
for the certiﬁcate courses will be awarded the appropriate certiﬁcate.
Certiﬁcates are awarded on the dates when degrees are conferred (with
the exception of the Information Technology Certiﬁcate, which can be
awarded prior to graduation). Students must complete the “Application
for Graduation", form which is accessible through WebAdvisor via the
myMU student portal, the semester prior to the completion of the
certiﬁcate. Certiﬁcates will be awarded after graduation from Monmouth
University for students also in baccalaureate programs. Curriculum
charts for certiﬁcate programs are available on the Monmouth University
Web site (https://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/documents/) or through
the myMU student portal.
These Certiﬁcate Programs are not related in any way to Certiﬁcation
Endorsement Programs for teachers.

Air Force ROTC
Monmouth University and Rutgers University have an agreement
permitting students at Monmouth University to cross-enroll in the Air
Force Reserve Ofﬁcers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program at Rutgers
University. The Air Force ROTC program provides students the
opportunity to study and train for careers in the U.S. Air Force. Students
who successfully complete the program are tendered commissions as
second lieutenants.
To qualify for enrollment, a student must be physically qualiﬁed,
be enrolled as a full-time student, and be of good moral character.
Enrollment in the Air Force ROTC involves no military commitment
during the freshman and sophomore years. The advanced portion
of the program is contractual and is scheduled during the junior and

senior years. Obligations include enrollment in the Reserves, successful
completion of ﬁeld training between sophomore and junior year, and
acceptance of a reserve commission, if tendered.
Monmouth students must complete a “Permission to Take Courses” eFORM prior to taking classes at Rutgers in order to have the ROTC credits
apply toward degree requirements.
Students cross-enrolling for the ROTC courses are charged separately
by Rutgers for these courses. Uniforms and textbooks are supplied
to all students enrolled in both the basic and advanced programs. A
deposit fee is required for textbooks and uniforms. This fee is refunded
when textbooks and uniforms are returned. Students enrolled in the
advanced program receive a subsistence allowance from the Air Force
while enrolled.
Air Force ROTC scholarships of various lengths are available. These
scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic performance, scores
on the Air Force Ofﬁcer Qualifying Test, results of a medical examination,
and a personal interview.

Services for First-Year Students
The Ofﬁce of First Year Advising in the Center for Student Success is
a key resource for ﬁrst-year students (entering with less than ﬁfteen
credits) at Monmouth University, offering academic advising and major
and career services for all ﬁrst-year students. First Year Advising offers
programming designed to help ﬁrst-year students experience the
challenges, opportunities, and support needed to succeed at Monmouth.
Students are encouraged to take part in academic and co-curricular
activities that are supported by this ofﬁce to promote their growth and
learning.

Academic Advising

Academic Support Services

All ﬁrst-year students receive comprehensive academic advising from
specially trained faculty as part of our First Year Advising Program.
Although most students tend to think of advising as simply assistance in
registering for courses, the Ofﬁce of First Year Advising strives to build an
advising relationship that works holistically to help students develop their
academic, career, personal, and social interests.

The Center for Student Success

New Student Orientation

The Center for Student Success (CSS) provides academic and career
counseling for all students. Academic advising for transfer students
is coordinated in the CSS. The Center administers Monmouth's Early
Warning System (MEWS) for several student populations including ﬁrst
year students, athletes, and undeclared sophomores. MEWS is utilized to
identify students who are experiencing academic difﬁculty and connects
them to their advisors and/or appropriate learning resources across
campus. Advising for undeclared sophomores is designed to help with
exploration of different majors while taking courses that satisfy degree
requirements. Students are required to declare a major no later than the
end of sophomore year. Additionally, throughout the year, the CSS offers
numerous workshops related to academic, personal, and career topics.
Many services and resources are available in the CSS to assist students
with career exploration, career planning, part-time employment,
cooperative education, internships, service learning opportunities,
experiential education, and job placement. Students are provided
assistance in exploring their career values, interests, and skills.
All students have the opportunity to attend career fairs and meet with
many prospective employers who visit the University at the invitation
of Career Services. In preparation, students are given professional
assistance in writing effective résumés and in acquiring interviewing
skills to make the fullest possible use of these opportunities. In order
to maintain close ties between the University and its students after
graduation, Monmouth continues to offer these services to alumni.
Opportunities are available to students and alumni through Hawks Career
Link (https://www.monmouth.edu/career-services/hawks-career-link/),
our online job board.
The CSS provides administrative support for the Experiential Education
requirement. Please refer to the Experiential Education Requirements
section of this catalog for a complete description of the requirement and
the related Web site.
The Ofﬁce of Service Learning and Community Service provides students
with information about service learning and volunteer opportunities in
nonproﬁt agencies, schools, and governmental organizations. Through
service learning and volunteering, students can explore their personal,
career, and intellectual potential while increasing their knowledge of
community needs.

All incoming ﬁrst-year students attend a two-day/one-night New Student
Orientation in the summer, which is coordinated by the Ofﬁce of Student
Life, in collaboration with the Division of Enrollment Management and
the Center for Student Success. Orientation provides a snapshot view
of life at MU: students meet faculty and advisors; register for their ﬁrst
semester; learn about academic, career, personal, and social choices;
and, perhaps most importantly, make connections with other ﬁrst-year
students. Special programs are also offered to students matriculating in
the spring semester. During new student orientation, ﬁrst-year students
are advised and registered in classes for the fall semester.

Major and Career Choices
Monmouth University believes that everyone can beneﬁt from career
advising, whether it involves help in choosing a major, access to career
interest resources, development, mentoring, or a workshop on résumé
writing. First Year Advising offers students a great deal of support with
their major and career choices. Students can assess their career interests
in a variety of ways, and we strongly encourage all ﬁrst-year students to
begin this exploration as early as possible.

Online Community: SOAR
SOAR (Support, Orientation, Advisement, and Registration) is an online
community for new students that provides important information relevant
to their ﬁrst year and beyond. SOAR provides critical information about
many ﬁrst-year experiences, including career and major exploration
opportunities, help in understanding course requirements for majors, and
information for building student schedules.

Parent Orientation
It stands to reason that parents, guardians, and family members who are
informed are better prepared to help their ﬁrst-year students navigate
the challenges ahead. Parents are encouraged to become familiar with
transition issues, the nature of how a university works, the federal laws
affecting the sharing of student information, and the wide variety of
resources, support services, and activities available to students. The
Ofﬁce of Student Life coordinates Parent Orientation, which is designed
to help family members of incoming ﬁrst-year students learn more about
Monmouth University and how to help their students make a successful
transition to college life. Generally held in June (prior to their student’s
New Student Orientation), these programs provide a broad range of

58

Academic Support Services

information and the opportunity to meet with representatives from
various departments across campus.

Services for Transfer Students
The Ofﬁce of Transfer Services assists undergraduate students
transferring in eighteen or more credits. Initially, Transfer Services
connects deposited students with their faculty advisors for course
registration and academic advisement, while acting as a second layer of
support for new students.
Transfer Services also helps transfer students transition into Monmouth
University. Our online pre-orientation highlights academic and transfer
credit policies, career and academic support services, and guides
students to complete their preparations before classes begin. Transfer
New Student Orientation welcomes students to campus by providing a
dynamic venue to explore helpful resources while forming connections
with faculty, staff, and student peers.
Lastly, Transfer Services plans workshops, events, and individual
appointments to assist current transfer students. Programming focuses
on helping students maximize their academic potential, explore career
options holistically, and prepare for life after Monmouth.

Reverse Transfer
Students who transfer to Monmouth University from a New Jersey
community college now have the opportunity to complete their associate
degree through credits earned at Monmouth. Students can “reverse
transfer” credits taken as part of their bachelor’s degree back to their
former community college by meeting the criteria below outlined in The
Statewide Reverse Transfer Agreement. (http://catalog.monmouth.edu/
undergraduate-catalog/academic-programs-support-servicesregulations/academic-support-services/statewidereversetransfer.pdf)
Eligibility
In order to participate in the reverse transfer process:
• Students must have met the residency requirement and designated
minimum grade point average at the community college prior to
enrollment at the four-year institution.
• Students must have applied and been admitted to the four-year
institution.
• Following enrollment at the four-year Institution, students must
have earned a cumulative total of 66 semester hours between the
community college and the four-year institution.
• Students must be current with ﬁnancial obligations to both the fouryear institution and the community college.
• Students must have met all of the graduation requirements of the
community college.
How it Works
Please visit The Ofﬁce of Transfer Services’ Reverse Transfer
website (https://www.monmouth.edu/transfer-services/?
page_id=882&preview=true) for information on how to initiate the reverse
transfer process.

Student Success Services
Student Success Services, including Tutoring and Writing Services and
the Math Learning Center, provide personalized academic assistance.

workshops on strategies for college success, such as organization
and time management, note-taking and listening skills, college
textbook reading strategies, and test-taking preparation. For more
information, please contact Tutoring Services at 732-263-5721, by e-mail
(tutoringservices@monmouth.edu) or by visiting the Tutoring Services
Web site (http://www.monmouth.edu/tutoring/).
Peer, professional, and faculty writing assistants are available to help
students with all stages of the writing process, across all disciplines,
from the initial drafting of the assignment through the ﬁnal stages
of editing and proofreading. Writing Services also offers assistance
with grammar and punctuation skills and documentation styles.
Students can make an appointment for writing services online
(https://mu.accudemia.net/Private/Main.aspx?Referer=http://
www.monmouth.edu). For more information, please contact Writing
Services at 732-571-7542, by e-mail (writingservices@monmouth.edu) or
by visiting the Writing Services Web site. (http://www.monmouth.edu/
writing/)
Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a peer-facilitated academic assistance
program designed to help students succeed in traditionally difﬁcult
courses. SI sessions are regularly scheduled, informal review sessions
that involve collaborative learning activities through which students can
clarify course concepts and practice the types of study strategies that
will help them truly master the information and skills required by the
target course. For more information about SI, please call 732-263-5530 or
visit the SI Web site (http://www.monmouth.edu/si/).
The Math Learning Center, located in Howard Hall room 203, provides
students with assistance in all levels of mathematics. Peer tutors are
available to help students solve problems and to review concepts. In
addition, students may use the Center to do homework assignments
or to study for tests while having a student tutor available. For more
information, contact the Department of Mathematics at 732-571-4461.

Disability Services
Accommodations and support services are available to students with
learning disabilities and/or ADHD, vision or hearing loss, physical
disabilities, medical diagnoses and health conditions, and psychological/
psychiatric diagnoses. Students with documented disabilities may
request reasonable accommodations and auxiliary aids that will enable
them to participate in programs and activities at Monmouth University.
The Department of Disability Services (DDS) works with students who
choose to register with the ofﬁce, submit documentation that supports
the request for accommodations, and self-disclose to professors every
semester.
A variety of accommodations are available to students with disabilities
who attend Monmouth University. These include, but are not limited to,
extended time to complete exams, testing in a distraction-reduced or
private setting, use of a calculator or computer with Microsoft Word, and
access to digital media materials and assistive technology software.

Undergraduate 20-21

In order to be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations,
adequate and updated documentation of a student’s disability must
be submitted to the DDS ofﬁce. Documentation must include a
speciﬁc diagnosis of a disability and support the particular academic
accommodation(s) being requested. Students should contact the DDS
ofﬁce for particular documentation requirements or questions regarding
eligibility or services.

Educational Opportunity Fund
Program
The Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF) is one of the nation’s most
comprehensive and successful state-supported efforts to provide access
to higher education for economically disadvantaged students. EOF
assists low-income New Jersey residents by providing supplemental
ﬁnancial aid to help cover college costs and provides academic support
services, developmental counseling, and career guidance throughout
the student’s college career. EOF students must be enrolled full-time. A
ﬁve-week, residential, pre-freshman summer program is required of all
incoming EOF freshmen. Additional information is available from the EOF
Ofﬁce, located in the 600 Building.

Pre-Professional Health Advising
Programs
Pre-Health Advising for Medicine,
Dentistry, and Other Health Careers
Designed to foster motivated, caring, and communicative students who
intend to pursue careers as physicians and healthcare professionals,
Monmouth University’s pre-medical, pre-dental, and health careers
preparation charts a uniform course of study under the mentorship of the
Pre-Health Advising. The preparation encompasses all undergraduates
intending to attend medical school, dental school, or any graduate course
of study in the health professions.
Pre-Health advising prepares undergraduates for medical school as
well as other health professional schools, including dental, veterinary
medicine, physician assistant, physical therapy, public health, and
occupational therapy. The Committee members are from the science
faculty and have strong interests in career advising. Pre-Health
Advising works closely with the Center for Student Success (CSS) and
Undergraduate Admission.
Most pre-medical students major in biology or chemistry, as a strong
foundation in basic science is vital to success in professional education.
However, it is possible to major in another ﬁeld, and to take the
prerequisite science courses for professional schools. Students from
diverse majors, including Spanish, psychology, and health studies, have
been successful by being exceptional in both their majors and in science
courses. Non-science majors are encouraged to use their free electives
for biology and chemistry courses, as taking more science than the
minimum prerequisite courses for professional schools is advised.
An increasingly complex and global medical profession demands
healthcare professionals to have broad cultural knowledge and excellent
communication skills. Therefore, Pre-Health students are encouraged
to excel in humanities courses as well as in science. Students geared
towards a career in healthcare should also seek out volunteer and
shadowing opportunities as early as possible. Leadership skills can be
enhanced through participation in campus clubs and organizations.

59

Preparation for health professional schools begins in the freshman year.
Incoming ﬁrst-year students are encouraged to indicate their future
career aspirations to their academic advisor during orientation. The
sequential nature of the natural and physical science courses chosen
requires careful planning if students are to meet the requirements of their
chosen professional schools. Throughout the academic year, students
are encouraged to attend update meetings on the various professions,
informal presentations by healthcare providers, and informational
sessions on career preparation run by the Pre-Health Advising.
Committee members attend the major national and regional health
profession conferences to remain current, concerning both developments
in the ﬁeld and medical and professional school requirements. In addition
to course advisement, Pre-Health Advising members provide students
with information on admissions tests, such as the MCAT (Medical College
Admission Test) and the DAT (Dental Admissions Test), and prepare
students for entrance interviews at professional health schools. The
Committee also composes and provides a comprehensive letter of
recommendation to professional health schools, which is one of the most
important parts of the admissions package.
The Pre-Health Advising is pleased to offer the following afﬁliation
programs:

Pre-Medical Preparation and be taken at MU as a PostBaccalaureate student

P

Pass. This grade is given for
satisfactory completion of a course
that is graded on a Pass/Fail basis.
This grade is not used in computing
a student’s cumulative grade point
average (GPA).

R

Re-Registration Required. This
undergraduate grade is given when
a student has made signiﬁcant,
but not sufﬁcient, progress in a
developmental course. (See section
entitled Developmental Courses.)
This grade is not used in computing
a student’s cumulative grade point
average (GPA).

is given at the end of the ﬁrst
semester when satisfactory
progress has been made in a
course, which is part of a sequence
of courses that take more than one
semester to complete.

AU

Audit. This grade is given to a
student who attends a class for the
purpose of acquiring knowledge,
without earned credits. The auditor
is expected to attend classes, do
assigned reading, and participate
in class discussions, but is not
required to take examinations.

Grades
The grading system is as follows:
Grade

Description

A, A-

Exceptional performance

B+, B, B-

Strong performance (for
undergraduate students); Average
(for graduate courses)

C+, C, C-

Adequate performance (for
undergraduate courses); Poor (for
graduate courses)

D+, D, D-

Poor performance (available for
undergraduate courses only)

F

Failing performance. This grade
is given for failure in a course; for
unofﬁcial withdrawal from a course
after the deadline (see “W” grade);
or, in some instances, when an
Incomplete grade is not changed by
the end of the next regular semester
(see “I” grade).

61

62

I

Undergraduate Grade Point Averages

Incomplete. This grade is given
in cases where permission has
been granted by the instructor to
postpone completion of speciﬁc
required work, such as a laboratory
project or report or a missed ﬁnal
examination. This grade is not
intended for situations where, in
the judgment of the instructor, the
student must retake the course for
an entire semester in order to earn
a passing grade. The Incomplete
grade, therefore, should not be used
in cases where a grade of “W” or “F”
would be appropriate. The student
must complete the work within the
time granted by the professor and
no later than the end of the next
regular semester. If the unﬁnished
work is not completed within the
speciﬁed time, an “F” grade will
be recorded, unless the instructor
indicates otherwise at the time the
Incomplete was originally approved.
Not available for thesis courses. For
thesis courses that are graded on
a Pass/Fail (P/F) scale, when the
grade of “I” is assigned, the grade
will be converted to “‘S’.” Similarly,
in non-thesis courses graded on
the P/F scale, when the grade of
“S” is submitted, the grade will be
converted to “I”.

NR

No Report. This temporary grade
is given by the Registrar when no
grade has been received from the
instructor at the time that ofﬁcial
grades are issued.

X

Credit by Exam. Portfolio Credit.

Q

Waived. This graduate grade is
determined by the appropriate
department to indicate that certain
course requirements are waived.
This grade is not computed in
the student’s grade point average
(GPA).

Undergraduate Grade Point Averages
Grade points are awarded for each credit on the basis of grades as
follows:
Grade

Value

A

4.0

A-

3.7

B+

3.3

B

3.0

B-

2.7

C+

C-

1.7

D+

1.3

D

1.0

D-

0.7

P

0.00

F

0.00

Thus, if a student completes a three-credit course with a grade of A,
twelve (12) grade points are awarded. To calculate the grade point
average (G.P.A.) for a given semester, a student should divide the number
of grade points awarded by the number of credits attempted (excluding
withdrawals and developmental courses). The ofﬁcial G.P.A. is rounded to
two decimal places.
To calculate the cumulative G.P.A., the total number of grade points
awarded is divided by the total number of credits attempted (excluding
withdrawals) in all sessions at Monmouth University. Calculation of a
major GPA includes all courses falling under the major/interdisciplinary
portion of a program.
Grades received in developmental courses are not counted in the
computation of the student’s semester or cumulative grade point
averages. Refer to Repeating a Course for a discussion of repeating a
course and its impact on the G.P.A.

Repeating a Course: Impact on the
G.P.A.
Students have one opportunity to repeat any regular course in which
a grade of “F,” “D-,” “D,” “D+,” or “C-“ has been assigned. On-demand or
requested courses (independent studies, co-ops, special topics classes,
etc.) are not grade repeatable, in that the second grade earned will not
replace a prior grade. When a course is repeated, the second grade for
the course will be used in calculating the cumulative grade point average,
regardless of whether the second grade is higher or lower than the ﬁrst. If
both attempts of the course earned passing grades, only the most recent
set of credits and grades will be applied to the student’s academic record.
Students cannot repeat a scheduled course using an independent study
for G.P.A. improvement.

Grade Reports
A grade report is e-mailed to each student approximately ten days after
the end of each semester. Final grades are recorded on the student’s
ofﬁcial academic record. The Ofﬁce of the Registrar does not respond
to individual requests for grades until after the grade reports have been
generated. All students are provided with a WebAdvisor student account
through the University portal, myMU, that enables them to view their
grade reports online. Undergraduate midterm grades are only provided
online.

Student Complaints About Grades
A student who wishes to ﬁle a complaint about a course grade should
attempt ﬁrst to resolve the matter through a discussion with the faculty
member who taught the course in question. If the faculty member is
unable to resolve the matter, the student may contact the department
chair in writing, stating the basis of the complaint. Such complaints
should be sent to the appropriate department chair within six weeks
following the receipt of ﬁnal grades. Before changing a grade, a chair
must, in a timely manner, attempt to discuss the grade with the faculty

Undergraduate 20-21

member who assigned it. A student who is not satisﬁed with the decision
of the department chair may appeal the decision in writing to the dean
of the school housing the course. The decision of the academic dean is
ﬁnal. A faculty member who disagrees with a chair's change of grade may
also appeal the chair's decision in writing to the dean, whose decision is
likewise ﬁnal.

63

are strongly urged to avoid attempting more courses than they can
complete satisfactorily.

Auditor Classiﬁcation

Change of Grade Requests

An auditor is a student who attends a class for the purpose of attaining
knowledge but not to earn credits. The auditor is expected to attend
classes, do assigned readings, and participate in class discussions but is
not required to take examinations.

In those rare cases where a faculty member determines that a change
of grade is warranted, the request must be submitted and approved by
the department chair and school dean. All changes must include speciﬁc
reasons that support the proposed change. Changes beyond one year
require the additional approval of the Academic Standards and Review
Committee (ASRC). Students are not permitted to complete or submit
additional work after a term/semester concludes in an effort to improve
a grade, unless the original grade was an "I" (incomplete). Changes to
grades after a student has graduated will not be considered.

Students who wish to audit a class must complete a “Permission to
Audit a Class” e-FORM, which is available from the student’s WebAdvisor
student account, accessible from the Monmouth University portal, myMU.
The permission form must be received prior to the third class meeting.
Auditor registration is subject to course section availability. No more than
two (2) courses may be audited per semester. Students may not change
the status of their registration in a course to “audit” or to “for credit”
during the term. Auditors may be removed from classes after registering
if seats are needed for matriculating students.

Undergraduate Graduation Rates
Graduation rates for the student cohorts of ﬁrst-time, full-time freshmen
are available at the Ofﬁce of Institutional Research and Effectiveness
located in Great Hall, room 206.

Academic Deﬁnitions
Undergraduate Student Classiﬁcation
Regular (Matriculated)/Non-Matriculated

All students—those attending during the day, in the evening, or weekends
—are classiﬁed as either regular (matriculated) or non-matriculated.
A regular (matriculated) student is one who has been admitted and who
intends to earn a degree. The class standing is determined by the number
of credits earned as follows:
Year

Credits

Freshman

0–29.5 credits

Sophomore

30–59.5 credits

Junior

60-89.5 credits

Senior

> 90 credits

A non-matriculated student is one who is not a candidate for a degree.
Non-matriculated students are subject to the same fees and regulations
as regular students. See the Admission (p. 22) section of this catalog for
further information about admission as a non-matriculated student.

Full-Time/Part-Time
Undergraduates who carry twelve (12) or more credits during a semester
are classiﬁed as full-time students. The normal semester course load for
full-time students is ﬁfteen (15) to eighteen (18) credits. Those who carry
fewer than twelve (12) credits are classiﬁed as part-time students.

Maximum Course Load
Undergraduate students who wish to carry nineteen (19) to twentyone (21) credits in a regular term must obtain the permission of the
department chair. Students wishing to enroll for more than twenty-one
(21) credits need the permission of both their department chair and
school dean. Undergraduate students are limited to twelve credits total
for the summer without prior permission from the school dean. Students

Part-time students who audit classes will be charged at the audit rate
regardless of their status (matriculated or non-matriculated); the audit
rate is one-third of the regular per-credit tuition rate.
Full-time undergraduates whose total semester credits (including those in
audited classes) are in the twelve (12) – eighteen (18) range will be billed
at the full-time tuition rate. If a full-time undergraduate audits a class
whose credits put the total credit load in excess of eighteen (18) credits,
the credits beyond eighteen (18) will be billed at the audit rate.
The transcripts of auditors, who, in the judgment of faculty members,
do not attend class or participate sufﬁciently, will not reflect the audited
courses.

Credit Hours Deﬁned by Course Type
Information regarding credit hours by course type (http://
www.monmouth.edu/university/credit-hours-deﬁned.aspx) is available on
the Monmouth University Web site.
This resource provides the following information for all lecture, seminar,
laboratory, clinical, and art studio classes:
• Course-type deﬁnitions;
• Minimum contact time per week;
• Minimum instructional time total;
• Minimum out-of-class student work per week and total per semester;
• Total number of instructional contact hours and student work out-ofclass hours.

information regarding this topic.

Undergraduate Honors and Awards
Dean’s List
The Dean’s List is the ofﬁcial recognition of outstanding academic
achievement. Inclusion on the Dean’s List is based on the comparative
semester grade point average for that semester. Monmouth University
students who fall within the top 20 percent of their major program by
semester grade point average are recognized on the Dean’s List for that
semester. Undeclared students will be grouped as one major. Students
pursuing multiple degrees will be eligible for the Dean’s List if they fall

64

Curriculum of Record

within the top 20 percent of any major they are pursuing. In addition to
the requisite class standing, a student must have a cumulative grade
point average above 3.30 and must have completed all semester course
work, except for the Honors Thesis Preparation and the Thesis. This list is
compiled each spring and fall semester immediately after the conclusion
of the semester. Part–time students will be evaluated for inclusion on the
fall or spring semester Dean’s List each time twelve or more credits are
accumulated in successive semesters. Credits utilized for inclusion on
the Dean’s List will not be considered for subsequent Dean’s Lists.

Graduation with Honors
To be graduate with honors, a baccalaureate degree recipient must
have earned at least ﬁfty-three (53) credits at Monmouth University and
have a cumulative GPA no lower than 3.50. Three levels of honors are
distinguished and indicated on the diploma:
• cum laude for students earning a GPA between 3.50 and 3.64;
• magna cum laude for students earning a GPA between 3.65 and 3.84;
and
• summa cum laude for students earning a GPA between 3.85 and 4.00.

1. credit standing for priority registration,
2. credits earned for freshman athletes, and
3. credits completed for the determination of academic probation and
eligibility for academic dismissal.
Students who successfully complete developmental mathematics
will earn grades of “A” through “C-”; “D” grades are not used for
developmental courses.
Students who are required to enroll in developmental courses, all of
which carry the course number “050,” must satisfactorily complete
their developmental course work within one year following their initial
registration. Students who, on the ﬁrst attempt, make satisfactory
progress but do not complete all course requirements will receive a
grade of “R” (see “GRADING (p. 61)”) and are required to re-register
for that course during the following semester. Students who do not make
satisfactory progress in developmental courses will receive a grade of
“F” (see “GRADING (p. 61)”), are required to re-register for that course
during the following semester, and are on academic probation until the
course is successfully completed.

Students who received academic amnesty (see Academic Amnesty for
more information) are not eligible to graduate with honors.

Students who have not passed required developmental courses by
the end of the second semester will be subject to review, and possible
dismissal, by the Academic Standards and Review Committee.

Department Honors

Academic Regulations

Department Honors are available for undergraduate students majoring in
Art, Biology, Chemistry, English, Foreign Language with a Concentration
in Spanish, Sociology, or Political Science. Department Honors are noted
on the student transcript, and a letter will be issued by the chair of the
department.

Curriculum of Record
A student’s curriculum of record is the set of degree requirements
associated with the student’s particular major that is in effect at the
time that major is declared. If major requirements are changed, students
may elect to update to the newer version of the major requirements by
sending written notiﬁcation to both the major department and the Ofﬁce
of the Registrar.
The ofﬁcial curriculum of record is maintained in the Ofﬁce of the
Registrar. Students may review their curriculum requirements from their
academic audit which is available through the University portal, myMU,
under WebAdvisor for Students. Please select the "Registration" menu
item and locate Academic Audit/Program Evaluation.

Undergraduate Developmental
Courses
Developmental courses are deﬁned as those that have pre-college-level
content. Students are required to enroll in and successfully complete
developmental courses that are speciﬁed as a result of the placement
testing process. These courses are designed, and required of the
students who place into them, in order to provide students with the skills
needed to succeed in college-level work. Such courses carry institutional
credit only, will not be used to satisfy degree requirements, will not be
counted in the computation of the student’s semester or cumulative
grade point average, and will not be counted toward the total number
of credits needed for graduation. However, successfully completed
developmental courses will be considered in the calculation of

Academic Amnesty
Academic amnesty provides former students of Monmouth University
an opportunity to improve their grade point averages by extending to
them the privileges enjoyed by transfer students. A former student of
Monmouth University must be away from the University for at least
three years and have a cumulative grade point average less than 2.00
before being eligible to receive academic amnesty. Students considering
academic amnesty must apply for amnesty concurrently with their
application for readmission. If academic amnesty is granted, credit will
be given for all courses with grades of “C” or better and as many courses
with grades of “C-,” “D+,” “D,” or “D-” as possible while maintaining a grade
point average of 2.00 or better. All courses with “F” grades will be given
amnesty. Students who receive veterans’ educational beneﬁts who are
approved for academic amnesty should be aware that they will not be
entitled to VA beneﬁts when taking courses that satisfy requirements that
were satisﬁed prior to academic amnesty.
Academic amnesty may be granted to a student only once, and amnesty
will be posted after the student re-matriculates at the University. A
student receiving amnesty must still meet the residency requirement by
taking the last thirty credits at Monmouth University with a minimum of
ﬁfteen (15) in the major ﬁeld. Students who receive Academic Amnesty
are required to complete additional course work in order to ﬁnish a
program. Such students may not be considered for graduation with
honors.
Under no circumstances will grades earned by a student at Monmouth
University be expunged from the student’s permanent record or excluded
from any transcript sent from Monmouth University.
Courses that receive no credit under the grant of amnesty shall not be
offered later for fulﬁllment of any degree requirement, and a grade point
average adjusted by amnesty shall not be used to determine general
honors upon graduation.

Undergraduate 20-21

Evaluation of applications for academic amnesty shall be made by the
Academic Standards and Review Committee in consultation with the
appropriate departments. The Committee will inform the Registrar of its
decision and of courses affected by the granting of amnesty.

Academic Honesty
Monmouth University encourages its students to grow intellectually
as well as to become responsible citizens in our complex society. To
develop their skills and talents, students are asked to conduct research,
perform experiments, write papers, work individually, and cooperate in
group activities. Academic dishonesty subverts the University’s mission
and undermines the student’s intellectual growth. Dishonesty in such
academic practices as assignments, examinations, or other academic
work cannot be condoned. A student who submits work that is not
original violates the purpose of Monmouth University and may forfeit
their right and opportunity to continue at the University.
The University has an obligation as an educational institution
to be certain that each student’s work is their own. Note that
Monmouth University faculty members have access to Turnitin (http://
www.turnitin.com), a Web-based plagiarism-detection resource that
compares the text of student papers to an extensive electronic database.
This database includes current and archived Internet resources,
periodicals, journals and other publications, and past student papers from
Monmouth and other educational institutions. All student assignments
may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to Turnitin
(http://www.turnitin.com) for the detection of plagiarism. All submitted
papers may be included as source documents in the Turnitin reference
database (solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers).
Faculty are expected to inform students in advance about which
assignments will be checked for originality using Turnitin. Use of the
Turnitin service is subject to the Usage Policy posted on the Turnitin site
(http://www.turnitin.com).

Academic Probation
A major concern of the University is to provide students with appropriate
notice whenever their academic status is in jeopardy. Academic probation
is designed to serve this purpose.
Any full-time freshman student who fails to achieve a GPA of 1.50
following the ﬁrst semester will be placed on academic probation;
however, such a student who fails to earn at least a 1.50 GPA will be
considered for academic dismissal. Any part-time freshman student who
fails to achieve a GPA of 1.50 during the ﬁrst nineteen (19) college credits
completed will be placed on academic probation. Any student who has
earned a minimum of eighty (80) credits and who fails to achieve the
minimum major GPA as established by the content major will be placed
on academic probation until his or her major GPA reaches the graduation
minimum.
All other students are placed on probation when the cumulative GPA
falls below 2.00. Additionally, any student who receives a grade of “F” in
a developmental course will be placed on probation and will remain on
probation until the course is successfully completed.
Students on probation should not be absent from any classroom exercise,
scheduled class function, laboratory, or conference period. Furthermore,
they may not compete in nor travel for varsity sports or hold ofﬁce in
any University organization. Students on academic probation are not
permitted to self-register using WEBregistration, but instead must make
all schedule changes with their academic advisor.

65

Students on probation are urged to seek academic counsel from their
faculty advisors or department chairs to help them improve their
academic standing. They may be advised to curtail employment, change
their major curriculum (see Academic Probation), reduce the number of
credits attempted, or restrict participation in extracurricular activities.
Students who are not on academic probation are considered to be in
good academic standing.

Academic Dismissal
A student shall become subject to academic dismissal for any of the
following conditions and may be dismissed without prior warning:
• For failing to meet these minimum standards:

Credits completed include credits for all courses not ofﬁcially
withdrawn from, and all transfer credits accepted by, Monmouth
University (though only credits earned at Monmouth are computed in
the GPA).

• For failing to earn a semester GPA of at least 1.00 (if a full-time
student), or a GPA of 1.00 in any combined consecutive semesters
within which at least twelve credits have been attempted (if a parttime student);
• For failure to earn a passing grade in a required course after the
maximum number of allowable repeats (see Repeating a Course);
• For failure to earn the minimum major GPA as set by the content
major after three (3) consecutive semesters;
• For failure to successfully complete all required developmental
courses within the ﬁrst year of attendance;
• Upon the recommendation of the student’s chair or school dean.
A student who has been dismissed for the ﬁrst time has the right to
appeal that decision in writing to the Academic Standards and Review
Committee. Second dismissals are not subject to appeal except for
factual error. A student may apply for readmission three years after
the second dismissal. See Readmission to the University after Academic
Dismissal for information on readmission following academic dismissal.

Attendance
Monmouth University believes that attendance is essential to success in
academic courses. Therefore, class attendance is required. The University
believes that learning is an interactive process dependent in part on the
student and is not just a matter of the passive absorption of information.
The University also believes that to beneﬁt fully from their respective
courses, students need to participate in, and contribute constructively to,
the classroom experience, and, secondly, that the success of any course
depends as much on what students contribute to the class as on what
the instructor presents.
Grades in courses are normally based on academic performance
(participation, contribution, and examination). However, individual faculty
members may adopt reasonable regulations that additionally relate
grades to class attendance. All professors must state their speciﬁc
attendance policies in a written statement containing the pertinent
course requirements and give it to the students during the ﬁrst week of

66

Graduation

the semester. A student who may not be present at a particular class or
laboratory is, nevertheless, responsible for adhering to the attendance
requirements of the course. A student absent from class due to inclement
weather may not be penalized for that absence but are required to
contact their faculty regarding the timely completion of assignments.

The class should be given at a time agreed upon by both the student and
the faculty member on or before the end of the fourteenth week class
period.

Students are not permitted to attend classes for which they have not
ofﬁcially registered (as determined by the Ofﬁce of the Registrar). If
students attend without prior registration, they are subject to disciplinary
actions, inclusive of suspension and/or dismissal, and will not be
permitted to “retroactively” enroll.

All undergraduate students are required to complete a minimum of
120 credits; some degrees require more credits. Individual program
requirements are included on the applicable department page of this
catalog. Additionally, all undergraduates must meet a minimum 2.00
overall grade point average (GPA), a minimum major GPA of 2.10 (except
for Education majors who are held to a 3.00 minimum GPA), and, if
applicable, a minimum 2.10 minor GPA. Calculation of a major GPA
includes all courses taken within the major and courses cross-listed
within a major.

Course Withdrawals
Students are expected to complete the courses for which they register.
On occasion, however, withdrawals are warranted. (See section entitled
“GRADING (p. 61)” for a description of the “W” grade and associated
procedures.) Students who do not intend to complete any course for
which they are ofﬁcially registered should execute an ofﬁcial withdrawal
prior to the “W” deadline.
The ofﬁcial date of a withdrawal form is the date it is received in the
Ofﬁce of the Registrar. The student is responsible for completing the eFORMS request prior to the deadline date.
Students withdrawing from some courses while remaining registered for
one or more courses are required to complete a “Withdraw from Course
Form,” available from e-FORMS. The ofﬁcial date of a withdrawal form is
the date the completed form is received in the Ofﬁce of the Registrar and
must be received prior to the Withdraw (“W”) deadline date as published
in the Academic Calendar (http://www.monmouth.edu/university/
academic-calendars.aspx).
Students who are withdrawing from all their courses are encouraged
to make notiﬁcation of withdrawal in writing; however, verbal or e-mail
notiﬁcation is acceptable under the guidelines set forth in “Refund Policy
for Complete Withdrawals—fall and spring semester.” (p. 35)
Except under unusual circumstances, such as prolonged illness, a
student will not be permitted to withdraw from course work any later
than ﬁve weeks prior to the last day of classes of the semester or its
equivalent in a shorter term. In these exceptional cases, students will be
withdrawn from all course work in the term.
Students who do not complete courses and who have not executed an
ofﬁcial withdrawal prior to the deadline indicated will receive “F” grades
for such courses.
Students wishing to withdraw from classes after the speciﬁed
withdrawal deadline must provide documentation of serious extenuating
circumstances; the documentation will be reviewed by the appropriate
faculty members teaching the courses, the department chairs, the deans
of the schools in which the course(s) are housed, and the Registrar.

Fourteenth Week Class Schedule
Fourteenth week classes shall be held during a time scheduled by the
University.
Fourteenth week information is available on the "Registration
Information" (http://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/
registration_information/default.asp) page of the Monmouth University
Web site. A student who has three or more fourteenth week classes
scheduled in one day may request that one of them be rescheduled to
another day. It is normally the middle one of the three that is rescheduled.

Graduation

Diplomas are mailed 2-3 weeks following the graduation date, provided
that all University obligations have been met. In addition, Monmouth
University provides a Certiﬁed Electronic Diploma (CeDiploma), an ofﬁcial
and veriﬁable PDF version of the diploma. A link to download the
CeDiploma will be sent by email 2-3 weeks following the graduation date
In those rare instances when a student has not met all degree
requirements, but for whom a change to the academic record is
received by the Ofﬁce of the Registrar within one week following the
graduation, the student will be considered for the earlier graduation. The
effective date of the change must be on or before the actual date of the
graduation. Changes received later than one week beyond graduation
will not be considered for prior graduation but will be part of the next
graduation cycle.
Only students who have completed all graduation requirements,
including, but not limited to, course work, credit requirements, GPA
minimums, residency requirements, and the like, will be allowed to
participate in Commencement.

Independent Study
Independent Study courses permit a student to pursue a research project
or guided readings in a subject area not substantially covered in the
curriculum. Normally, no more than one Independent Study course may
be scheduled during a single academic term.
A student's advisor must submit the appropriate e-FORM, Undergraduate
or Graduate Independent Student Application, on the student's behalf.
The form will be routed by the Registrar's Ofﬁce to the supervising
professor, department chair, and school dean for their approval prior to
registration in the course. Generally, students are expected to complete
no more than six (6) credits of independent study. Any exceptions must
be approved by the dean of the school in which the student’s major is
housed. Failure to process the Independent Study Application within the
required timeframe may impact ﬁnancial aid status and may jeopardize
participation in Commencement.

Portfolio Assessment
Students interested in a portfolio assessment must have attained
matriculated status and accumulated a total of at least six (6) college
credits at Monmouth University. There is a non-refundable fee per area of
assessment (please refer to the current catalog for the fees). Interested
students should download, complete, and submit the Application for
Portfolio Assessment to the Registrar’s Ofﬁce (which shows proof of
payment), along with one copy of their portfolio. The form is available

Undergraduate 20-21

on the Registrar’s forms page. (http://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/
forms.asp)

Repeat Policy: Repeating a Course*
A course in which a grade of “C” or higher has been earned may not be
repeated without the student ﬁrst obtaining written permission from the
appropriate department chair and the dean of the school in which the
student is enrolled. If written permission is not received, the student may
be administratively dropped from the course.
Students have one opportunity to repeat any regularly offered course
in which a grade of “F,” “D-,” “D,” “D+,” or “C-” has been assigned. Ondemand or requested courses (independent studies, co-ops, special
topics, service learning, or certain experiential education courses) are
not grade-repeatable in that the second grade earned will not replace a
prior grade. When a course is repeated, only the second grade for the
course will be used in calculating the cumulative grade point average,
regardless of whether the second grade is higher or lower than the ﬁrst. If
both attempts of the course earned passing grades, only the most recent
set of credits and grades will be applied to the student academic record.
Students cannot repeat a scheduled course with an independent study
for GPA improvement. The permanent academic record will contain a
listing of all course registrations and grades. Students wishing to repeat
a course ordinarily should do so no later than the next time that course
is offered at Monmouth University during the regular academic year.
Exceptions must be approved by the advisor.

67

Permission to Take Courses at
Another Institution
It is expected that Monmouth University students, once enrolled, will
complete all degree requirements at Monmouth University. However, in
recognition that students may, on occasion (usually in the summer), have
sound academic or personal reasons to take courses at other accredited
institutions, they may request permission to do so. In evaluating such
requests, consideration will be given to the relationship between the
student’s classiﬁcation and the type of institution the student seeks to
attend.
A student who requests permission (using e-FORMS) to take courses
at another institution must be in good academic standing. The student
should not be enrolled in classes at Monmouth during the semester or
term in which permission is sought. The student must receive permission
in advance from the chair of the department in which the student’s major
is housed, the school dean, and the Registrar. The student must present
supporting evidence of course equivalency. Permission is granted for
free elective courses and required courses outside the major but not
for general education or major courses. Major courses include courses
within the concentration, if any. Students may not repeat a course at
another institution that they have previously attempted at Monmouth
University.

If, after repeating a course once, a grade of “C” or higher has not been
earned, at the request of the student, a determination will be made by
the appropriate dean, upon recommendation of the department chair,
as to whether special circumstances exist to justify a second repeat
of the course. When a course is repeated for the second time (third
attempt), only the third grade for the course will be used in calculating
the cumulative grade point average, regardless of whether the previous
grades for that course are higher or lower than the third. A student found
to be registered for a second repeat of a course, who has failed to obtain
the dean’s permission in advance, will be administratively dropped from
the course.

Once a student attains junior status (completed sixty-one [61] or more
credits), permission will not be given to take courses at any two-year
institution. For credit to become part of the student’s Monmouth
University transcript, a grade of “C” or higher must be earned at the other
institution. For such courses, the grade earned at the other institution
does not calculate in the Monmouth University grade point average;
a “T” grade is posted to the student’s academic record, except when
there is a ﬁnancial aid consortium agreement in place. Students with a
ﬁnancial aid consortium agreement will have the actual grades posted to
their academic record but the grades will not have any G.P.A. impact. In
accordance with Monmouth University’s residency requirement, students
who are within thirty (30) credits of graduation are not eligible for this
permission.

*Note:

Graduate Courses for Undergraduates

Please consult with your department to determine if your program requires
that a course(s) be completed with a grade higher than "C". A course repeat
would be necessary if the minimum grade requirement set by the department
has not been achieved. Students must also consult with their department
to determine what impact course repeats may have on continuation in their
program.

Student (Biographical) Data
Any currently enrolled student whose biographical data (e.g., name,
address, or Social Security number) has changed must inform the Ofﬁce
of the Registrar in writing. Requests for name or Social Security number
changes must be accompanied by legal documentation. Biographical
information is not changed for previously enrolled students; alumni
should contact the Ofﬁce of Alumni Affairs to report biographical
changes.

An undergraduate student at Monmouth University who has an
outstanding academic record may apply for permission to take graduate
courses while completing the work for a bachelor’s degree. Please review
the requirements listed below before submitting a request:
1. Students must have an overall GPA of 3.0.
2. Requests are subject to approval by the graduate program director
and are subject to course availability and program policies.
3. Students must submit the “Undergraduate Request to Take a
Graduate Course” e-FORM requesting that the course apply to either
the current undergraduate program or a future graduate program.
4. Students seeking course substitutions for graduate coursework from
the stated undergraduate degree requirements of their academic
program should consult with their academic advisor. If the advisor
recommends a substitution, the “Substitution of Undergraduate or
Graduate Program Requirement” e-FORM will be submitted to their
respective department for review.
5. Credits in excess of 150 may count toward both the undergraduate
and graduate degree if the plan sequence chart allows it and it is
approved by the graduate program director, undergraduate major

68

Submission of the Same Paper or Computer Program for Two Courses

chair, and dean of both the undergraduate and graduate degree. The
total credits of both degree programs must be equal to or greater
than 150. A minimum of 120 credits must be applied toward an
undergraduate degree, and a minimum of thirty (30) graduate credits
must be applied toward a graduate degree.

Submission of the Same Paper or
Computer Program for Two Courses
The submission of the same (or essentially the same) paper or computer
program for two separate courses without the expressed permission
of all faculty members involved is against University policy. (Please
refer to the Academic Honesty policy included in this catalog for more
information.)

Time Limitation for Completion of
Requirements
The requirements of a particular baccalaureate curriculum must be
satisﬁed within a period not exceeding eight calendar years. The
Monmouth University catalog in effect at the time of admission,
readmission, or change of major shall normally be the student’s ofﬁcial
catalog of record. However, faculty and curriculum changes may require
related changes in a student’s program. If after following a curriculum
of record for eight calendar years a student has not completed the
requirements of the curriculum, the student must update the curriculum
of record (including general education requirements) to the most recent
one that exists.

Substitution of Requirements
Students seeking course substitutions or any deviations from the stated
degree requirements of an academic program should ﬁrst consult with
their academic advisors. If the advisor recommends a substitution, the
“Substitution of Undergraduate or Graduate Program Requirement” eFORM should be submitted to their respective department for review. The
department will forward their decision to the Ofﬁce of the Registrar for
processing. Students will receive an e-mail to their Monmouth University
e-mail accounts after the substitution request has been completed,
unless the substitution was initiated by their advisor. In that case,
students should follow up with their advisors to make sure that their
substitution has been completed. If the department chair does not
approve the substitution, the student may appeal that decision to the
school dean. If the school dean does not approve the substitution, the
student may appeal that decision to the Provost. The Provost has ﬁnal
authority concerning the substitution.
Students should avoid processing substitution forms close to the time
of graduation; instead, substitutions should be effected as warranted
in academic planning sessions with academic advisors. Deadlines
to submit substitutions for graduating students are provided on the
“Registration Information” (http://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/
registration_information/default.asp) page of the Monmouth University
Web site.

Academic Procedures
Scheduling Information
Fall and Spring Semesters

Monmouth University schedules on-campus classes year-round. During
the fall and spring semesters, in addition to the traditional schedule
of daytime classes, Monmouth also offers non-traditional students
other scheduling options. Courses are available in the evening and on
weekends.

Summer Sessions
Summer sessions provide a comprehensive program of day and evening
courses and special workshops for Monmouth students and students
in good standing at other colleges and universities. Summer session
programming also provides a taste of college life and a head start for
high school students who have completed either the junior or senior year.
Because of Monmouth’s location near the shore, summer sessions are
well attended by visiting students as well as Monmouth’s own students.
The University offers ﬁve regular summer sessions. The maximum course
load for summer school is twelve (12) credits.
Students enrolled at other institutions should receive approval from that
institution for courses for which credit is desired. Students must meet
all course prerequisites. Admission into the summer program does not
constitute acceptance into the University’s regular programs.
Campus recreational and dining facilities are available to summer
students. Residence halls will be open to resident students during the
summer. Inquiries regarding summer sessions and applications for
admission should be addressed to the Director of Admission.

The Monmouth University Student Portal,
myMU
All currently registered and deposited Monmouth students have
established student accounts for use in schedule preparation, grade
and transcript look-up, and academic audits. Students should login to
the student portal, myMU, to become familiar with this account so that
they can retrieve their academic information. Questions concerning the
account can be answered by the Help Desk (732-923-4357), or by utilizing
the documentation and tutorials that are linked from the student menu.
Examples of information obtainable online include:
• Instructions and Links (e-FORMS)
• Personal Academic Information (Grades, GPA, Schedule)
• Registration (Academic audit, Search for Courses, Prerequisite
Worksheet)
• Graduation (Apply to Graduate)
• Financial Information
WebAdvisor is available for general use to view the Schedule of Course
Offerings. “Search for Courses” is not restricted by User ID and password
and is accessible to all users. Monmouth University provides a menu
selection accessible from WebAdvisor for students that allows currently
enrolled students to electronically submit academic requests to the
department and to the Ofﬁce of the Registrar.
Current students initiate requests with the Academic Affairs Division by
utilizing the e-FORMS selection available from their WebAdvisor menu.

Undergraduate 20-21

Instructions about how to use WebAdvisor for students and e-FORMS are
posted under “Instructions” on the WebAdvisor for students main menu.

Withdraw from the University
Students who intend to withdraw from Monmouth University and plan
not to return are requested to notify the University by completing a
“Total Withdraw from the University” e-FORM. Provided the e-FORM
is received by the “W” deadline date (see academic calendar (http://
www.monmouth.edu/university/academic-calendars.aspx)), students will
be withdrawn from the current term; otherwise the total withdraw will not
be effective until the next regular term.

Application for Graduation
As you approach the completion of your program, students must review
their academic audits through the Monmouth University portal, myMU, in
order to monitor their degree progress. After the completion of seventyﬁve (75) credits you are required to submit an "Application for Graduation"
form to the Ofﬁce of the Registrar or you will be blocked from all future
registration activity. The application is available in the student portal
under the WebAdvisor for Students tab.

Participation in Commencement
Only students who have completed all degree requirements are
permitted to participate in Commencement exercises. All application
deadlines for graduation, substitutions of program requirements, grade
changes, waivers, transfer credits, and the like are outlined on the
“Registration Information” (https://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/
registration_information/default.asp) page of the Monmouth University
Web site. Failure to meet any of the deadlines may impact inclusion in
Commencement-related activities.

Change of Major
The choice of a major can have dramatic impact on life and career goals.
Undergraduates considering changing majors should be aware that
academic advising, including interest testing, is available to them through
the Center for Student Success.
Students who wish to change their majors should seek the advice of the
chair of the proposed new department and make themselves familiar with
the requirements of the new major. To make the change, students should
submit a “Request to Change Curriculum” e-FORM. (Note: Freshmen
students must consult with their advisors in the First Year Advising Ofﬁce
in order to change their major.) The Ofﬁce of the Registrar will review
the application and route it to all appropriate parties for their approval.
Students will receive an e-mail once this form has been successfully
processed. Students must fulﬁll the requirements of the new major that
are in effect at the time of the change of major.
Undeclared majors are required to ofﬁcially declare a major by the end of
the sophomore year. Failure to do so will prevent registration for future
semesters. An undeclared student who has maintained continuous
matriculation under earlier general education requirements may elect to
follow those general education requirements when declaring a major. See
Curriculum of Record (p. 64) for additional information.

69

Changing from Non-Matriculated to
Regular (Matriculated) Status
An undergraduate student accepted to Monmouth University as a nonmatriculated (non-degree-seeking) student may request to matriculate
(seek a degree) by applying for admission as a regular (matriculated)
student. If accepted as a regular student, he or she may declare a major
(provided admission criteria, if any, of the particular major are met) or
choose the undeclared status.
A non-matriculated undergraduate student who did not meet regular
admission requirements when accepted in the provisional nonmatriculated status must complete a minimum of twelve (12) credits and
a maximum of eighteen (18) credits of college-level course work with a
minimum grade point average of 2.00 before applying for admission as a
regular student. The student will follow all curricular requirements in effect
at the time of admission as a regular student.
Courses taken in the non-matriculated status will be considered for
applicability toward degree requirements in the same way that courses
taken in the matriculated status are considered. Undergraduate students
wishing to change from non-matriculated to regular status should contact
the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admission.

Course Changes (Add/Drop)
Students can add or drop classes at any time during the open registration
period or until the conclusion of the Add/Drop period (as outlined in the
Academic Calendar (http://www.monmouth.edu/university/academiccalendars.aspx)) using the Register/Remove Previously Selected Courses
feature in the student portal or with the assistance of their academic
advisor/department.
Students who want to petition to add a closed class must complete a
“Registration: Add Class Form (http://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/
forms.asp#PRINT)". This form must be printed and approved by the
instructor, department, and/or dean. Students attempting to add a
closed class after the Add/Drop Period has ended must also obtain
permission from the Bursar. All forms must be brought to the Ofﬁce
of the Registrar for processing immediately after all approvals have
been obtained; the forms will not be accepted after the term concludes.
It is the responsibility of the student to see that all forms reach the
appropriate ofﬁce.
Students who want to petition to add an open class after the Add/Drop
period has concluded must submit an "Add Open Course" e-FORM. The
e-FORM will be routed for all of the required approvals including the
Bursar's Ofﬁce. The Bursar's Ofﬁce will not approve the form until all
ﬁnancial obligations for the course have been satisﬁed.
Students simultaneously adding and dropping a course (e.g., same
course, different section) should use e-FORMS and select “Swap Course
Registration.” Approvals for this action will be done electronically, and
since there is no credit change, Bursar approval is not required.

Leave of Absence
A leave of absence (LOA) enables students to maintain the same
curriculum of record if they intend to be away (no active registration)
from the University for a full semester. Interested students should
submit an LOA request e-FORM in order to be placed on a leave; eFORMS are accessible through the Monmouth University student portal,

70

Registration

myMU. The deadline to submit this request is by the conclusion of the
course change (add/drop) period. Please consult the ofﬁcial University
academic calendar (http://www.monmouth.edu/university/academiccalendars.aspx) for speciﬁc dates. All degree requirements must be
completed as speciﬁed in the “Time Limitation” section of this catalog.
Students on a LOA may not attend another institution and transfer credits
back to Monmouth University.

Registration
All current Monmouth University students and deposited “Applicants”
are provided with access to the University’s student portal, myMU. These
students are provided with a unique User ID and password, which allows
them to view their personal student information and to conduct their
personal student business via the Web.
Continuing students who have met with their academic advisor and
received permission to do so may self-register using the registration tools
linked from the student portal during the registration period. Speciﬁc
information for dates and times to register online will be distributed to
each student in advance of this period. Other important information
regarding registration is available on the “Registration Information”
(http://www.monmouth.edu/registrar/registration_information/
default.asp) page of the Monmouth University Web site. Online
registration is not available to students who are on academic probation or
whose current admission status is conditional.
Continuing students are strongly urged to complete “early registration”
for upcoming semesters and terms. Early registration for the fall, spring,
and summer semesters usually begins in April and concludes in August.
Late registration is conducted during the ﬁrst week of the fall and spring
semesters; students are required to pay the “late registration” fee when
registering during the late registration period. Registration after the
conclusion of the late registration period requires the written approval
of the appropriate faculty and department chairs. Students are not
permitted to attend classes for which they are not ofﬁcially registered (as
determined by the Ofﬁce of the Registrar). If students attend without prior
registration, they are subject to disciplinary action, including suspension
and dismissal, and will not be permitted to “retroactively” enroll.
New students are invited to register during special programs during the
summer and in January as part of their orientation to the University. Late
registration is available to new students, although it is less desirable than
the mode described above.
Registration privileges are not extended to students who have signiﬁcant
unresolved ﬁnancial or other obligations to the University. “Holds” are
placed on the records of such students. Upon resolution of the obligation,
registration privileges are restored. Course prerequisites are updated
periodically. Students should confer with their advisors concerning
the most recent prerequisites on record for courses they wish to take.
Students should also confer with their advisors when they want to
register for more than eighteen (18) credits per semester. Students must
fulﬁll the most current prerequisite requirements prior to taking courses
at Monmouth University.

Transcript Requests
Current students, former students and alumni may request printed
transcripts through the National Student Clearinghouse. (https://
tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/school/select/) If your request to
Clearinghouse is received before 4:00 pm (E.T.) the printed transcript will
be mailed the following business day. Students and alumni also have

the option, at an additional cost, to have their printed transcripts mailed
overnight, sent certiﬁed mail, or mailed to an international address. Please
note the Clearinghouse envelope containing the transcript cannot be opened
by a student or alumnus since it will render the transcript, “unofﬁcial”
If you need a PDF copy of your transcript, or if you need it processed
immediately, you may also request it through the National Student
Clearinghouse. (https://tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/school/select/)

Transcript Holds
The University is not obligated to provide transcripts to students or
alumni whose ﬁnancial obligations to the University have not been
satisﬁed.
Pursuant to NJ LAW A4001/S1914, effective 01/01/06, Monmouth
University transcripts will include only the last 3 digits of the Social
Security Number (SSN). In those instances where the student SSN is
required for the recipient, request a “student sealed ofﬁcial.” It is the
student’s responsibility to communicate their SSN to the recipient.

University Emergency Closing
Monmouth University has established a Weather Emergency Information
Line: 732-263-5900. During emergencies, including weather-related
situations when the University may need to close or delay the start of
the workday, this line will have a prerecorded message with necessary
information for students and staff. If the University must close or cancel
classes, a broadcast message will also be sent to all employees and
resident students via the campus alert system. You may also ﬁnd out
about weather-related cancellations and closings by e-mail messages,
the Monmouth University Web page (http://www.monmouth.edu), social
media posts, or from one of the local radio stations or TV channels listed

The Wayne D. McMurray School of Humanities and Social Sciences

THE WAYNE D. MCMURRAY
SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES AND
SOCIAL SCIENCES
Interim Dean: Richard F. Veit, Ph.D.
Associate Dean: Michael Paul Thomas, M.F.A.
The Wayne D. McMurray School of Humanities and Social Sciences
prepares students for lifelong learning and effective engagement with
a changing world. The humanities give critical insight into aspects of
thought, values, and achievement in all times and places. The social
sciences contribute an understanding of the structure and function of
society. Both areas provide a foundation for major courses of study
that prepare students for productiveness and responsibility in both
their careers and civic life. Undergraduate and graduate curricula
provide strong programs that prepare students for successful entry
into professions and advanced study. The School of Humanities and
Social Sciences fosters critical, social, political, and cultural thought by
creating new knowledge, sound, and art. By doing so, the school creates
an intentional active learning environment through which students can
make a meaningful and long lasting impact.
The Wayne D. McMurray School offers twenty-three undergraduate
degree programs and master’s degrees in:
• Addiction Studies
• Anthropology
• Clinical Mental Health Counseling
• Communication
• Communication with a Concentration in Interactive Digital Media
• Communication with a Concentration in Strategic Public Relations
and Social Media
• Criminal Justice

Anthropology
Chair: Christopher DeRosa, Department of History and Anthropology
The Anthropology curriculum is designed to provide a liberal arts
education that emphasizes the scientiﬁc study of humanity. Three areas
of Anthropology are covered:
• Cultural Anthropology, the comparative study of human beliefs and
behavior with special attention to non-Western societies;
• Archaeology, the study of the human cultural heritage from its
prehistoric beginnings to the recent past; and
• Biological Anthropology, the study of racial variation and the physical
and behavioral evolution of the human species.
The goal of the Anthropology program is to provide students with a broad
understanding of humanity that will be relevant to their professions, their
daily lives, and their larger roles in the modern world.

Chair: Frederick McKitrick, Department of Art and Design
Compliance Ofﬁcer/Technical Specialist: Mark Ludak
Director of Galleries and Collections: Scott Knauer

• Photography (p. 98)

The Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree (B.F.A.) in Design and Animation (with
concentrations in Animation and Graphic and Interactive Design) is
a career-track program that prepares students for professional work
in the ﬁelds of graphic design, computer graphics, Web design, and
animation or for graduate school. Entering freshmen will be accepted as
B.F.A. degree candidates. As sophomores, or in the fourth semester at
Monmouth University, B.F.A. degree candidates will be required to pass
the Art and Design Student Portfolio Review (AR-REV). Upon successful
completion of the AR-REV, B.F.A. degree candidates will be ofﬁcially
accepted into the B.F.A. degree program. If a student fails to pass the
AR-REV, he or she will be referred to a Student Review Committee, which
will determine whether the student should change his or her major or
be given a conditional semester or year. Transfer students can declare
themselves a B.F.A. candidate upon acceptance to Monmouth University.
Transfer students will also be required to pass the ﬁrst given AR-REV.
The BA in Art is designed for students who seek a strong studio
experience and the option of developing skills useful in several
professional areas. The core of the degree is traditional studio work in
foundations, drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, and ceramics.
The B.A. in Art with a Concentration in Photography is a more focused
program on photographic skills, both traditional and digital. All art and
design majors are required to complete a one- to three-credit internship
during their senior year. Additional internship and cooperative education
opportunities are offered as electives starting in the junior year.
Department Honors will be earned based on the following criteria being
met:
• An overall GPA of at least 3.3
• A major GPA of at least 3.5
• Completion of AR-410 Advanced Project I (1-3 cr.) and AR-411
Advanced Project 2 (1-3 cr.)
• Artifacts having been publicly presented with a reading and defense
of research topic
• Project and paper to have a combined average of a “B” or better

HS-107 Love and Marriage in Historical Perspective
Credits: 3
Term Offered: All Terms
Course Type(s): HS.SV
Love and Marriage in Historical Perspective is a reading-and-discussionbased thematic history course. This course is designed to expose
students to the history of love and marriage from classical antiquity to
the present in global perspective. Marriage is one of the oldest social
institutions in human culture: and, as an institution, it has not always
been associated with the concept of love. This course considers the
transformation of marriage as both a public, private, political, economic,
social, and emotional institution that has been fundamental to the
development of human societies. This includes a discussion of the GrecoRoman world, the Middle Ages, the Romantic era and marriage in the
global village at the present. Why is traditional marriage on the decline in
Western societies? What is traditional marriage? When, why, and how did
the idea of love get tangled up with marriage and how successful has the
love-marriage connection been over time? Why is marriage in crisis? What
does love have to do with it? What are the revolutionary implications
of the rise and fall of marriage as a love-match? These are some of the
questions we will contemplate in this course as associated with issues
related to sex, gender, sexuality, race and class by examining love and
marriage in literature, poetry, music, and in philosophical treatises on the
subject utilizing the historical method as the primary approach.
HS-108 Human Gods: Science, Technology, and Culture in History
Credits: 3
Term Offered: Spring Term
Course Type(s): HS.SV
This is a readings-and-discussion-based history course on the interplay
between science, technology, and culture in human societies from
the scientiﬁc revolution to the human genome project. In this course,
we will explore the relationship between what science writer Richard
Rhodes has alluded to in his text The Making of the Atomic Bomb as a
"Republic of Science" and human culture, as coupled with discussion of
the connection between scientiﬁc discovery and technological advance
(an in turn how technology impacts human culture) within the context
of world history. The focal point of this course is to critically examine
how scientists are shaped by the cultures they live in and how scientists
and their discoveries impact culture. Speciﬁcally, we will contemplate
how cultural attitudes about race and gender shape scientiﬁc inquiry
such as with the emergence of race science in the age of Darwin during
the nineteenth century, and the emergence of eugenics in the early
twentieth century. The overarching theme of the course is "Human Gods"
because we will pay close attention to how scientists in their attempts
to manipulate nature in the sense "play god" and how playing god may
have devastating consequences for marginalized groups in particular and
humanity more generally. The various arenas of science and technology
including medicine, military technology, and computer technology are
examined to demonstrate how individuals, industries, and governments
have harnessed science and technology to control nature (such as with
disease control, other nations in warfare, and general human activity via
computer technologies).

Credits: 3
Term Offered: All Terms
Course Type(s): AT, GU
Provides an introductory survey of music in selected traditions and
cultures in global perspective. It explores music both as a phenomenon
of sound and a phenomenon of culture. It aims to familiarize students
with music sound and music structure of different peoples, to help them
appreciate music in its cultural context, to guide them in listening to
music on a basic analytical level, and to give them a broad global view of
music as a human activity/behavior with social functions and as artistic
expression. Special attention is placed on how political, economic, social,
and religious factors influence musical aesthetics and notions of identity
among performers and audiences-all concerns of Ethnomusicology.
MU-224 Global Popular Music
Credits: 3
Term Offered: All Terms
Course Type(s): AT, GU
In the age of globalization and the Internet, popular music (music
produced for commercial purposes and transmitted through mass media
to a large audience) is an increasingly global phenomenon and can
provide a unique perspective into the social, political, and economic
conditions of various cultures around the world. This course introduces
students to some of the popular musics from around the world through
the perspective of ethnomusicology, the study of music and culture
and the ways that they intersect and influence one another. Emphasis
is placed on analyzing musical innovations, trends, and movements in
relation to location, culture, counter-culture, and the social/geo-political
climate. In doing so, this course draws upon geographical case studies
of popular music (for example, Algerian Rai, K-Pop, Bollywood, Indonesian
dangdut, or the Afrobeat of Fela Kuti) to view how historical, social,
and political factors have influenced their development. These issues
will be explored through directed reading and listening assignments,
response papers, a mix tape project, and focused class presentations and
discussions.

Undergraduate 20-21

MU-227 Introducing the Beatles!
Credits: 3
Term Offered: All Terms
Course Type(s): AT, HY
This course addresses the Beatles' musical career in terms of their wideranging cultural and artistic influence. Particular attention will be devoted
to examining their songs within the context of their composition and in
terms of their place (and placement) on the band's albums. In addition to
investigating their biographical lives, we will discuss the Beatles' overtly
literary and textual intentions, especially their various attempts at irony,
parody, and satire. This course's chronological design is arranged in
order to capture the band's artistic trajectory from two-track recording
and the relatively primitive Please Please Me album through the sonic
heights of Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The White
Album, and Abbey Road. The thrust of this course is interpretive in nature,
with the Beatles' songs and albums receiving considerable scrutiny in
terms of their composition, production, and attendant musicianship.
Developments in recording and instrument technology are germane to
our understanding of the Beatles' evolving aesthetic, as is the bandmates'
development as songwriters who eventually eschew issues associated
with romance in order to address larger and more prescient subjects
in their music such as loneliness, oppression, nostalgia, ethics, and
redemption.

PS-365 Sports Law I: Governance and Regulation
Credits: 3
Term Offered: Fall Term
Course Type(s): PSAL
Sports law is a subﬁeld of law and political science that examines a
broad mixture of laws that apply to athletes and the sports they play.
Many legal scholars argue that the term "sports law" is a misnomer
because "sports" represent the convergence of activity and entertainment
that is governed by the legal system in its entirety. Accordingly, this
course provides an overview of many areas of the law, particularly in the
realm of governance and regulations. Through the assigned readings and
research projects, students will gain valuable insight as to how "sports"
are regulated by the laws of our country but also by the governing bodies

of each sport. This course is related to Sports Law II: The Business of
Sports Law in that both courses provide student with in-depth analysis
of law as it relates to sports but also how "sports law" impacts society,
business and the economy. However, the courses are non-sequential
and students can be successful in each course independent from the
other as they are both designed to be introductory courses related to
governance and regulation, and legal implications in the business of
sports, respectively.

Prerequisite(s): SO-101
Term Offered: Fall Term
Course Type(s): EX5, SIN
Encourages students to study education as a social institution using a
sociological lens, and to become involved with the education of youth
in the local area. The course is divided into three parts. The ﬁrst part
introduces students to the study of education as a social institution,
particularly examining how social inequalities such as race, class, gender,
and sexuality shape educational experiences of youth today. Students
will also examine the cultural, social, economic, and political structures
that shape education as a social institution. The second part of the
course involves preparing students to tutor youth in surrounding towns.
The preparation will be accomplished through theoretical discussions
of what it means to be a good tutor, and through practical training to be
administered in collaboration with local tutoring organizations. Through
the auspices of local organizations, the third part of the course involves
Monmouth students tutoring students from local schools in basic
subjects such as math, language arts, and social studies. Students must
be available to tutor three to four days a week for a total of ten hours per
week. This course is open to students who have completed twenty-nine
credits or more.

deﬁne the aging process and will study and practice ethnographic,
life history in order to conduct life histories of seniors within the local
community.

SO-403 Theories of Society II
Credits: 3
Prerequisite(s): EN-101, EN-102 and 9 credits in Sociology
Term Offered: Spring Term
Course Type(s): WT
The wide range of theoretical paradigms that characterized the
discipline of sociology from the emergent period of modernity to our
current postmodern era is investigated. In the ﬁrst half of the course,
the traditions of critical theory; structural functionalism; symbolic
interactionism; and phenomenology as key schools of thought in
the modernist period are examined. In the second half, the most
contemporary, and overlapping, additions to the theoretical landscape
in sociology in our study of feminist and gender theories; critical race
theories; post-modernism; and global theoretical perspectives are
examined. Throughout the course, there will be critical engagement in a
kind of "sociology of knowledge" as we situate these central ideas and
schools of thought in the classic theoretical traditions from which they
may intellectually descend, as well as in the more current political and
economic contexts that influenced the emergence of these contemporary
perspectives.

conducting original research in sociology in which they will ultimately
produce primary research, analyze data, and write up their ﬁndings,
discussion, and conclusions. This course allows students to begin
the work that they will complete in Sociology Thesis class (SO-491),
thus ultimately resulting in a ﬁnal Senior thesis. Students will write a
comprehensive thesis proposal including an introduction and statement
of purpose, theory section, literature review, and preliminary methods
section.

Undergraduate 20-21

SO-491 Sociology Thesis

Dean: Steven M. Bachrach, Ph.D.
Associate Dean: Catherine N. Duckett, Ph.D.
Assistant Dean: John A. Tiedemann, M.S.
Monmouth University’s School of Science is a community of teacherscholars actively fostering learning, quantitative reasoning, and scientiﬁc
inquiry among its majors and among all students. A goal of the School
is to lead in the innovative development and delivery of curricula and
in providing creative solutions to problems that include signiﬁcant
technical components. Educational programs provide a student-centered
learning environment that builds a foundation for lifelong learning,
critical thinking, and collaborative, technical problem solving. Faculty
scholarship interests include: original basic and applied research in
a range of disciplines and scholarly work on science education and
pedagogy. Undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to
participate in student-faculty collaborative research projects leading to
the acquisition and dissemination of new knowledge in the sciences.

Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET (http://www.abet.org).
The undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering program
is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET
(http://www.abet.org). The Chemistry and Physics Department is
approved by the American Chemical Society (ACS). All qualiﬁed advanced
chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical physics degree recipients
may receive ACS certiﬁcation of their degrees. All programs of study
are directed toward preparing students for working and living in a
multicultural, technologically complex, global environment.
Studies in the School of Science provide students with a solid
background in the technical aspects of their chosen scientiﬁc or
engineering ﬁeld, sufﬁcient to prepare them for further study in graduate
or professional programs, or to compete for access to employment
opportunities in industry or education. Core courses for the non-major
stress the nature of the scientiﬁc enterprise and the beneﬁts and risks
that scientiﬁc advances present to society rather than the digestion of
large doses of content from the discipline. Both major and non-major
courses emphasize the importance of critical thinking and cooperative

Chair: William Schreiber, Department of Chemistry and Physics

• B.S. in Chemistry with a Concentration in Biochemistry (p. 266)

Our curricula provide foundations in the traditional chemistry subdisciplines. The programs serve as excellent preparation for further
professional study in chemistry and related sciences, health professions
such as medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy. Careers in
academia, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, environmental
protection, forensics, government, industrial hygiene, information science,
patent law, science writing, toxicology, and education are open to those
whose initial ﬁeld of study is chemistry.
The Bachelor of Science in Chemistry provides a core curriculum of
chemistry while allowing sufﬁcient flexibility to combine it with a second
major, a minor, or elective biology courses for pre-medical studies, within
the total number of credits required for graduation. Completion of the
Chemistry and Education curriculum qualiﬁes graduates to apply for
Secondary Education endorsement as a chemistry teacher. Completion
of two additional courses provides eligibility for physical science
certiﬁcation, which is required for teaching chemistry or physics at the
high school level.
The Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with a concentration in Advanced
Chemistry provides a strong foundation in all ﬁve of the chemistry subdisciplines. Students planning to pursue graduate study in chemistry or
to seek employment in chemistry-related positions should follow this
program, which leads to a degree certiﬁed by the American Chemical
Society.
The Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with a concentration in
Biochemistry includes an introduction to the traditional subject areas
of biology as well as speciﬁc biochemistry courses. This program
is appropriate for students planning to seek employment or pursue
graduate study in biochemistry, or attend medical or other health
professional schooling. American Chemical Society certiﬁcation may be
achieved in this concentration by appropriate choice of electives.
The Chemistry faculty are engaged in research in many interesting areas.
Providing opportunities for student participation in these efforts is an
important priority for the department.
Departmental Honors can be earned in Chemistry if the following criteria
are met:
• An overall GPA of 3.3 or higher;
• A major GPA of 3.5 or higher;
• At least three credits of research;
• Completion of both Physical Chemistry I and II along with their
associated laboratory courses;
• Completion of a thesis with a grade of “B” or higher;

Chair: Daniela Rosca, Department of Computer Science and Software
Engineering
UNIX Administrator and Teacher: Joseph Chung

Bachelor of Science with a Major in
Computer Science
The Computer Science curriculum provides a solid foundation in the
computing sciences, preparing students for employment in industry or for
graduate school. Software design and development is emphasized along
with foundational computing concepts. The higher-level courses enable
students to explore a variety of topics, such as databases, networks,
artiﬁcial intelligence, scripting languages, game programming, UNIX
administration, and computer security.
The B.S. in Computer Science, which is accredited by the Computing
Accreditation Commission of ABET (http://www.abet.org), is
recommended especially for students who plan to attend graduate school
in computer science or who plan to specialize in scientiﬁc computing.
The educational objectives of the BS in Computer Science are to enable
graduates, within a few years after graduation, to:
• Work as effective team members or team leaders in the development
of computer and software systems covering a wide range of
business, educational and scientiﬁc applications.
• Enter professional careers in positions including computer
programmer, software tester, systems analyst, network administrator,
software systems designer, database manager, computer systems
integrator, software security analyst, and game developer.
• Undertake graduate studies and develop the knowledge and expertise
to complete advanced studies or do research in computer science,
engineering, and other scientiﬁc ﬁelds.
• Work in teams, communicating effectively with technical and nontechnical team members, clients, and customers, while meeting the
social and ethical responsibilities of their profession.
• Explore, synthesize, and implement ideas in their areas of interest and
activity.
• Adapt to new technologies and methodologies with the skills required
to react to a changing world.
Students interested in Computer Science but looking for a more flexible
curriculum may choose to pursue the non-ABET-accredited B.A. in
Computer Science. This program requires fewer math and science
credits, which allows students to take additional coursework or a minor in
other academic areas.

Bachelor of Science in Software
Engineering
The undergraduate Software Engineering curriculum, which is accredited
by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (http://
www.abet.org) is designed to give students a broad background in
both computer and engineering science with a heavy emphasis on
those aspects of software engineering that will enable graduates to
efﬁciently participate in the design, development, and deployment of large
software systems. Because of the sequential nature of the courses and

269

the number of requirements for engineering majors, careful planning is
necessary to complete the curriculum in four years.
The educational objectives of the BS in Software Engineering program
are to prepare software engineering graduates to do the following things
within the ﬁrst few years after graduation from the program:
• Obtain employment in organizations that develop or acquire software
and/or enter graduate school;
• Make strong contributions to teams that are responsible for the
speciﬁcation, design, construction, testing, deployment, maintenance,
or use of software systems;
• Develop experience in additional areas of professional specialty that,
when combined with their BSSE education, will continue the path
toward lifelong learning;
• Use their engineering, communications, interpersonal, and business
skills to advance their careers in a business, government, or
academic environment;
• Critically assess their engineering capabilities and acquire the
additional knowledge and skills they need to maintain currency within
their evolving work environment;
• Assist their employers’ organizations in achieving their business
goals.

The curricula in Medical Laboratory Science and Clinical Laboratory
Sciences are quite similar. Both prepare students to work as skilled
professionals in medically related laboratories. Students complete
three years of course work, focused on chemistry and biology, followed
by a one-year hands-on internship at one of several hospital sites.
Professionals in these areas provide laboratory data that is essential
to the diagnosis of diseases, management of patient therapy, and
maintenance of health. Graduates of these rewarding programs are highly
employable and enjoy excellent starting salaries. They also have the
potential for further career advancement in the ﬁeld.

School of Education

SCHOOL OF EDUCATION
Dean: John E. Henning, PhD
Associate Dean: Wendy Harriott, PhD
Assistant Dean: Tracy Mulvaney, EdD
The School of Education (SOE) was established in 1995 to broaden and
increase support for Monmouth University’s education programs. The
goal of the School is to provide highly effective programs to prepare
practitioners who can help all students learn in diverse school settings.
Candidates are mentored by a diverse faculty that models best practices
grounded in evidence-based research. The School seeks to foster
collaboration and partnerships among University faculty, students, staff,
school practitioners, and community representatives to improve student
achievement. Programs are rooted in the belief that all students can learn
and are guided by four key themes:
1. the importance of both pedagogical and content knowledge with a
commitment to lifelong learning,
2. an emphasis on collaboration and partnerships with schools and
local communities,
3. the essential role played by cultural diversity and individual
differences in the teaching/learning process, and
4. the need to develop educational leadership skills consistent with
professional ethics.
The School of Education’s mission is to be a leader in the preparation
of highly competent, reflective professional educators (e.g., teachers,
administrators, school counselors, speech-language pathologists,
behavior analysts, student affairs specialists, and reading specialists)
who have the knowledge, 21st century skills, and dispositions required
to improve the teaching and learning of students in a highly pluralistic,
democratic society. Toward this end, our candidates are prepared to
serve students from diverse identities in terms of abilities, age, culture,
ethnicity, family, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status.
The SOE programs emphasize state and national curriculum standards
with research-based best practice designed to improve student learning
and prepare P-12 students to be successful in the 21st-century global
economy. Programs are designed to improve a candidate’s critical
thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills as they apply these
core competencies to P-12 student learning. The School’s programs
also integrate state-of-the-art instructional technologies that can
be applied in K-12 classrooms, school administrative practices and
educational counseling. The School has its own computer lab and offers
online, hybrid, and Web-enhanced courses.

Curriculum and Instruction
Chair: Ruth Morris, Department of Curriculum and Instruction
Programs are designed to provide a strong liberal arts or sciences
background, a subject area major, a behavioral/social science sequence,
and signiﬁcant professional preparation for an elementary teacher (K–
6), an elementary teacher with subject matter specialization (K-8), and a
subject area (K–12) teacher.
Students with aspirations to earn certiﬁcation as an elementary teacher
are required to simultaneously complete the requirements of both the
BA program in Education and one of the BA programs in Anthropology,
Art, English, English/Creative Writing, Spanish, History, History/Political

Science, Interdisciplinary Studies for Elementary Educators, or Political
Science; or to simultaneously complete the requirements of both the
BS program in Education and the BS program in Mathematics. Students
in these programs will have two academic advisors—one in each
department. Students can also choose to pursue a BA in Interdisciplinary
Studies for Elementary Educators. Students in this program will have one
academic advisor from the School of Education.
Students with career objectives to earn certiﬁcation in a subject area,
K–12, are required to simultaneously complete the requirements of
both the BA program in Education and one of the BA programs in Art,
English, English/Creative Writing, Spanish, History, History/Political
Science, Music, or Political Science; or to simultaneously complete
requirements of both the BS program in Education and one of the BS
programs in Biology, Chemistry, Chemistry (physical science), Health/
Physical Education, or Mathematics. Students will have two academic
advisors—one in each department.
Students wishing to enhance their academic program and expand their
education may choose an undergraduate endorsement:
• English as a Second Language (ESL);
• Teacher of Students with Disabilities (TSD);
• Middle School (5-8) Endorsement (available to Elementary K-6 majors
in English, Math, Science, or Social Studies); or
• Early Childhood - P-3 (available to Elementary K-6 only).
One or more of these endorsements may be combined with a student’s
academic program.

Internal Progression Requirements
Students must meet New Jersey State mandated progression
requirements beginning an education program at Monmouth University.
This will require students to have a 3.0 grade point average (GPA),
achieve a passing score on the Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators
(CORE) (or achieve a score as regulated by the State of New Jersey
that is "approximately equal to the top third percentile score for
all test takers in the year the respective test was taken") and send
a completed assessment of written and oral communication skills to
the School of Education. Students must also complete the professional
education components at Monmouth University and meet current
standards of the Monmouth University School of Education and the
New Jersey Department of Education. The program includes ﬁeld
experiences beginning in the sophomore year, increasing in intensity
during the junior and senior years, and culminating in full-time clinical
practice (i.e., student teaching) in the second semester of their senior
year. Students are required to maintain a 3.0 GPA. Undergraduate
students in the School of Education must receive a minimum grade of
"C" in all required Education courses. If a grade below "C" is earned, that
course must be retaken and will follow the rules set forth in this catalog
referencing "Repeating a Course (p. 67)".
Transfer students must have a minimum GPA of 2.75 and will have one
semester of provisional status pending their attainment of a 3.0 GPA.
Transfer students will be permitted to take one or two education
courses as appropriate in the ﬁrst semester. Transfer students may
transfer a maximum of six (6) professional education credits from a twoyear institution. Please refer to the Internal Progression Requirements
in the paragraph above for additional State-mandated progression
requirements.

Undergraduate 20-21

Applications for clinical practice (student teaching) must be submitted to
the Ofﬁce of Certiﬁcation, Field Placements, and School Partnerships for
fall and spring placements. At this time, students are screened to ensure
that they have met the academic and professional standards required
for State certiﬁcation. Students must pass the appropriate Praxis II
examinations prior to student teaching and receive passing scores as
a requirement for State certiﬁcation. Candidates seeking Spanish or
Chinese certiﬁcation must also earn a passing score on the appropriate
ofﬁcial Oral Proﬁciency Interview (OPI) prior to clinical practice. English
as a Second Language (ESL) candidates must earn a passing score on
the ofﬁcial English OPI and English Writing Proﬁciency Test (WPT) for
certiﬁcation.

THE MARJORIE K.
UNTERBERG SCHOOL OF
NURSING AND HEALTH
STUDIES
Dean: Ann Marie P. Mauro, Ph.D., R.N., CNL, CNE, FAHA, FAAN
The Marjorie K. Unterberg School of Nursing and Health Studies was
established in 1998, having served as a Department of Nursing since
1981. The School of Nursing and Health Studies reflects in its philosophy
the mission of Monmouth University: to provide a learning process
and environment that enables students to realize their full potential
and enhance the quality of life for individuals, families, groups, and the
community; and to provide high-quality baccalaureate and graduate
education programs to a diverse student population for development
of potential leaders in nursing and health professions. Graduates are
committed to lifelong service to their chosen profession and prepared
to enhance the quality of life for diverse populations in a global and
increasingly interdependent society.
The baccalaureate degree in nursing prepares a generalist and is the
basis for graduate study and continuing education. Professional nursing
education focuses on the development of an accountable practitioner
and responsible citizen. Professional nurses need knowledge of the
liberal arts and sciences in order to understand the interrelating factors
that influence the health of individuals and society. This knowledge
facilitates their special obligation to promote a healthy environment for
all persons and enriches the conceptual base that supports development
of critical thinking and ethical decision-making skills.
Nursing is a learned profession with a unique body of knowledge.
Nursing is both a science based on scholarly inquiry and an art that
reflects speciﬁc skilled and complex human interactions. The breadth
of professional nursing knowledge and skills can only be attained
within higher education. Professional nurses require the capacity
to modify their roles and responsibilities as healthcare continues to
change. Baccalaureate education provide students with knowledge of
nursing science, enabling them to develop their personal philosophy and
framework for practice. This framework encompasses an understanding
of the past, present, and emerging roles of the professional nurse.
Baccalaureate graduates obtain entry-level positions and are eligible for
licensure as registered nurses.
The baccalaureate degree in health studies focuses on developing
professionals who will promote health and prevent disease across
diverse areas in medical, community, nonproﬁt, corporate, and
government settings. The focus on the sciences makes this major a good
ﬁt for students pursuing careers pathways and advanced education as
healthcare professionals.
The baccalaureate degree in health promotion prepares students for
careers in coaching, athletic training, and ﬁtness training, as well as
graduate or professional schools for physical therapy, exercise science
and other similar professions. The health and physical education
baccalaureate dual major K-12 education endorsement offers core health
studies and physical education for those students interested in obtaining
a K–12 teaching certiﬁcation. The curriculum content is aligned with

395

both the State of New Jersey certiﬁcation requirements and the National
Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).
Education for nursing and the health professions is idealistic and futureoriented yet sufﬁciently realistic to provide students with an opportunity
to develop justiﬁable conﬁdence in their intellectual, clinical, and practical
skills. This preparation can occur only within an environment that allows
for individual differences and fosters personal integration, healthy selfesteem, vital social awareness, enjoyment of leisure, and a sense of
commitment to the attitudes and values of the health professions.
Education is an active, ongoing process involving student-teacher
collaboration and experiential activity. The teaching-learning process
involves not only the teacher and the student, but also the social system
within a framework of dynamic relationships that promotes the change
and growth of individuals. It is recognized that students have the ultimate
responsibility for their own learning and professional growth. Students
are viewed as unique individuals with varying learning styles. Therefore,
a variety of experiences and teaching strategies are to enhance the
development of cognitive, affective, and psychomotor abilities within the
student.
The school offers the following programs:
• a Pre-Licensure Bachelor of Science in Nursing program (BSN) and
• an RN to BSN Bachelor of Science in Nursing program for registered
nurses;
• a Bachelor of Science in Health Studies program (choose the Exercise
Science or Health Science Cluster) for non-nursing majors;
• a Bachelor of Science in Health Studies/Physical Education program
(choose the Fitness and Wellness or Public Health Cluster)
• a Bachelor of Science in Health Studies/Physical Education program
with an Education Endorsement K-12;
• a Health Studies minor for non-nursing majors; and
• an undergraduate interdisciplinary certiﬁcate in gerontology.
The school offers an accelerated program:
• an accelerated, direct-entry Bachelor of Science in Health Studies/
Occupational Therapy Doctorate program (3+3)

knowledge in a variety of health disciplines by teaching students to:
analyze the causes and means of preventing disease and illness while
seeking optimal health, develop the responsibilities and competencies
of effective health educators, and advocate for the health of others. The
mission of the Health and Physical Education Department is to prepare
students to be well-rounded, service-oriented community members
and professionals in health/exercise sciences, health promotion, public
health, and education.
Health Studies graduates have secured employment in various healthrelated organizations as well as acceptance to graduate schools in
numerous health science disciplines. Health Studies students are
prepared for graduate programs including: Exercise Science, Health
Promotion/Public Health, Medicine, Occupational Therapy, Physical
Therapy, Physician Assistant, and Speech Language Pathology. All
students are encouraged to apply to sit for the Certiﬁed Health Education

to continue in the Pre-Licensure BSN program.
• After acceptance, and prior to starting classes, a student must
submit to the School of Nursing and Health Studies a certiﬁcate of
good health from a primary care practitioner, including a complete
health history and physical exam. Before beginning clinical
laboratory experiences, students will be expected to have a physical
examination, with associated laboratory studies, immunizations,
and criminal background checks, in accordance with the special
requirements of afﬁliation contracts with clinical agencies and
submit a copy of a liability and malpractice policy. Students with
criminal backgrounds may not proceed in the nursing program.

RN to BSN Program
The RN to BSN Bachelor of Science in Nursing program is designed
for graduate nurses from associate degree and/or diploma schools of
nursing. The program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate
Nursing Education (CCNE). Because this program is designed for the
working RN, whenever possible classes are scheduled to meet in one
three-hour block of time, one day per week. All courses except the seniorlevel laboratory class are offered on campus, hybrid, or online. Students
can therefore complete the entire BSN program in the evenings with
the exception of the senior-level laboratory course that will require
attendance one day/week for one semester. Many nursing courses have
an online component. Students may attend on either a part-time or fulltime basis.
Every applicant must submit transcripts from all previous educational
institutions attended. Each one will be individually evaluated. The
University accepts all previously earned college course credits, with
grades of “C” or higher, regardless of when they were earned, provided
that they fulﬁll requirements of the program. If a course already
completed is not required, it may be accepted as a free elective or, if
applicable, as a guided elective. Students whose science courses were
taken in diploma schools of nursing for which they received no college
credit may choose to take either Excelsior or CLEP exams (CLEP exams
must be taken before admission to Monmouth University), as appropriate,
to gain the college credit for their knowledge or they may choose to
repeat the course.
Once accepted, all students will be individually advised by a faculty
member from the School of Nursing and Health Studies.

Requirements for Admission to the RN to BSN Program
• Applicants for admission must have graduated from an approved
associate degree or diploma school of nursing.
• Be a graduate nurse who has taken or is eligible to take the NCLEX
Examination.
• Submit a copy of a liability and malpractice policy with minimum
limits of $1,000,000–$3,000,000 and have achieved a grade point
average of at least 2.00 in lower-division work.
• After acceptance, and prior to starting classes, a student must
submit to the School of Nursing and Health Studies a certiﬁcate of
good health from a primary care practitioner, including a complete
health history and physical exam. Before beginning clinical
laboratory experiences, students will be expected to have a physical
examination, with associated laboratory studies, immunizations,
and criminal background checks, in accordance with the special
requirements of afﬁliation contracts with clinical agencies.
• All students are expected to maintain membership in the Student
Nurse Association ANA/N.J.S.N.A. The faculty of the School of
Nursing and Health Studies at Monmouth University reserve the
right to dismiss a student from the program regardless of cumulative
grade point average if, in the opinion of the faculty, the student fails to
meet acceptable professional standards of behavior.

Undergraduate 20-21

The University will follow its normal procedure with regard to the transfer
of general education credit. University policy permits credits to be
brought to Monmouth by transcript evaluation or by Excelsior or CLEP
tests. Monmouth University Credit by Examination is also available.
The University will accept thirty transfer credits for nursing courses
completed in an associate degree or diploma program upon completion
of BSN courses.
Speciﬁc general education courses required in the program do not have
to be completed before acceptance. Those that have been successfully
completed at accredited institutions will be transferred, and the rest

THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL
WORK
Dean: Robin Mama, Ph.D.
Assistant Dean: Leah Lazzaro, D.S.W.
Director of the B.S.W. Program: Christa Hogan, Ph.D.
Director of the M.S.W. Program: Elena Mazza, Ph.D.
Social workers are concerned with improving the health and quality of
life of persons who are disconnected or excluded from larger society.
Social workers engage in practice at all levels, from working with children
to working with communities and governments. The profession and the
program at Monmouth are particularly concerned with human rights and
social and economic justice, the representation and support of vulnerable
or oppressed segments of the population, and direct-action strategies to
bring about positive change for the disenfranchised.
The central mission of the School of Social Work at Monmouth University
is to prepare its graduates for professional social work practice that
strives to secure social and economic justice, advance human rights,
and improve the quality of life of vulnerable families, individuals,
organizations, communities, and nations on the local, national, and global
levels.
The B.S.W. Program prepares students for generalist professional social
work practice. Secondarily, the B.S.W. Program prepares social work
students for graduate social work education. The B.S.W. Program also
introduces individuals within the University community to relevant social
work and social welfare issues.
On the foundation of a liberal arts tradition, students are engaged to
broaden and challenge their understanding, analysis, and evaluation of
human experiences and societies in the past and in the contemporary
world, and of families and individuals of varied cultural and social
contexts.
The curriculum supports this mission through three perspectives:
• social and economic justice through the advancement of human
rights,
• strengths-based empowerment, and
• practice with families within a global context.
Families within a global context deﬁne the initial focal social unit for all
social work practice at Monmouth University.
Our three perspectives inform both our B.S.W. and M.S.W. programs as
they contribute to the development of students’ knowledge, values, and
skills:
1. To conceptualize and contribute to social work theory, knowledge,
values, and skills on a generalist level for B.S.W. students, and on an
advanced, concentration-speciﬁc level for M.S.W. students through
three interrelated perspectives: social and economic justice through
the advancement of human rights, strengths-based empowerment,
and practice with families within a global context;

Student Life

STUDENT LIFE
The Division of Student Life at Monmouth University offers many
important services for resident and commuter students, undergraduates,
and graduate students as well. Staff members promote personal and
intellectual growth through a variety of programs and services while
aiding students in resolving problems and helping them transition to
the college experience. The Student Handbook is available on-line and
provides students with the policies and practices relevant to student life.
Students should become familiar with the handbook at the start of every
academic year.

Orientation
A student’s introduction to student life at Monmouth begins even before
classes start. All new students participate in orientation programs
designed speciﬁcally for their needs.

First-year Students
All new ﬁrst-year students, commuters and residents, are expected to
take part in a comprehensive two-day, one-night New Student Orientation
Program during the months of June and July. This structured program
includes educational and social activities designed to ease the transition
to college life at Monmouth and to give students opportunities to meet
and interact with other new students. Prior to the program, students
must complete an online Math Placement Assessment and may need
to complete a Language Assessment. During orientation, students will
attend an advising/registration program during which they will work with
a First-Year Advisor to develop a schedule for the fall semester. They will
also meet faculty, staff, and students with whom they'll be interacting
during the ﬁrst year.
Throughout the academic year, many programs are offered to continue
the transition process. The SHADOW Program, First-Year Service Project,
leadership development opportunities, and social programming are led by
the Coordinator of Transition and Leadership Programs.
Families of ﬁrst-year students have opportunities to come to campus
to learn about life at Monmouth University during their student’s ﬁrst
year on campus. The ﬁrst is a Parent Orientation, offered in June, before
New Student Orientation. Families will receive important information
about their student’s upcoming transition into life as a university student
and meet representatives from across the campus. All are invited back
to campus again for Family Weekend, which usually takes place in late
September or October.

Transfer Students
The Center for Student Success (CSS) coordinates the connections
between transfer students (with eighteen or more credits) and their
academic departments to ensure a smooth transition to Monmouth
University. In addition to their assigned faculty advisors, the CSS
serves as another level of support for their transition to Monmouth
University. We encourage all incoming transfer students to attend
transfer orientation, which is coordinated by the CSS prior to each
semester. Orientation programs afford new transfer students the ability
to connect with their peers and to learn about resources to guide their
progress toward graduation and life after Monmouth.

Housing Options
Residents
The University offers a variety of housing options in sixteen locations:
Beechwood, Cedar, Mullaney, Spruce, Willow, Laurel, Elmwood, Pinewood,
Oakwood, Redwood, and Hesse Halls; as well as Maplewood Hall, the
Garden, Great Lawn, and University Bluffs apartment complexes. Living
styles include traditional room arrangements designated for ﬁrst-year
students; suite style, usually for ﬁrst-year and upper-class students;
and apartments for juniors and seniors. Residence halls are typically
co-ed by floor/wing/room based on the building's conﬁguration, and
the majority of students share double rooms. In an effort to make a
comfortable match, new students are asked to complete a questionnaire
before room assignments are made. First-year and sophomore housing
is guaranteed for students who submit the required enrollment and
housing deposits and housing contract by the required deadline; as
well as out-of-state undergraduate students. For ﬁrst-year students, the
deadline is May 1. Graduate students are typically assigned to double
occupancy assignments at the University's owned or sponsored offcampus apartments based on space availability.
Each residential area is staffed by full-time professional Area
Coordinators who reside on campus. Each hall is staffed by Resident
Assistants, all of whom are intensively trained in providing assistance,
information, activities, and programs for resident students. The Associate
Vice President for Student Life, two Associate Directors of Residential
Life, and one Assistant Director of Residential Life reside near campus
and provide additional, professional support for the Residence Life
program.
All on-campus halls provide laundry facilities that utilize a smartphone
app. All resident students not living in a University-owned or -sponsored
apartment are required to be on a meal plan. These meal plans are not
transferable and all meals are allocated to a single student. Students may
choose either a carte blanche plan, which allows you unlimited access
to the Residential Dining Hall, or one of three “block” meal plans, which
provides students with a set number of meals for the semester. First-year
students may not select a “block” lower than 195 until their sophomore
year.
Depending on individual needs, cars may not be a necessary part of
campus living, as everything is generally within walking distance of
campus. Many students use bicycles to get around campus and the
surrounding community. Parking is extremely limited and a parking decal
purchased through MUPD is required. Students are discouraged from
having cars on campus so they may fully experience university life and all
that it has to offer.

Student Services
Commuters
There are traditional, non-traditional, full-time, part-time, graduate, and
undergraduate students who commute to campus every year. Monmouth
University recognizes commuter students are unique and have needs
that the University supports each semester. The Ofﬁce of Off-Campus
and Commuter Services (OCCS) is available to provide resources,
advocacy, and guidance to all commuter students who attend Monmouth
University. Incoming ﬁrst-year commuter students are offered guidance
and support as part of the Commuter Student Mentor program, in which
they have the opportunity to request a mentor during new student
orientation. Commuter students who are interested in getting involved

Undergraduate 20-21

are encouraged to contact the Ofﬁce of Student Activities by calling
732-571-3586 or any of over one hundred recognized clubs that are listed
in the Monmouth University Student Handbook.
There are a wide range of extra-curricular events and leadership
opportunities that take place every semester, and programs are planned
so commuters can participate during the day. Commuters can choose
from a number of meal plans operated by Gourmet Dining. Commuter
students can access breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night dining
options at a number of locations on campus. The locations include the
Rebecca Stafford Food Court, a Dunkin' Donuts, Magill Commons Dining
Hall, Shadows (Elmwood Hall), Plangere Center, Bey Hall Express, a
Convenience Store in Hesse Hall, and the Café at the Library. Declining
balance, cash, Visa, and MasterCard are available for use at all dining
locations on campus; however, we recommend students consider
purchasing a meal plan through the University. The Ofﬁce of Residential
Life administers both resident and commuter student meal-plans and
can be reached by phone at 732-571-3465. Commuter students will
ﬁnd parking at any time of the day or night. For more information,

Student Organizations
There are more than 125 different clubs and organizations on campus.
Active involvement in a club or organization helps a student develop
new leadership skills, career skills, and meet new friends. Students can

something related to a special interest or hobby. Each year the Ofﬁce of
Student Activities and Student Center Operations hosts an Involvement
Fair to assist students in getting connected to a club or organization.

HS-107 Love and Marriage in Historical Perspective
Credits: 3
Term Offered: All Terms
Course Type(s): HS.SV
Love and Marriage in Historical Perspective is a reading-and-discussionbased thematic history course. This course is designed to expose
students to the history of love and marriage from classical antiquity to
the present in global perspective. Marriage is one of the oldest social
institutions in human culture: and, as an institution, it has not always
been associated with the concept of love. This course considers the
transformation of marriage as both a public, private, political, economic,
social, and emotional institution that has been fundamental to the
development of human societies. This includes a discussion of the GrecoRoman world, the Middle Ages, the Romantic era and marriage in the
global village at the present. Why is traditional marriage on the decline in
Western societies? What is traditional marriage? When, why, and how did
the idea of love get tangled up with marriage and how successful has the
love-marriage connection been over time? Why is marriage in crisis? What
does love have to do with it? What are the revolutionary implications
of the rise and fall of marriage as a love-match? These are some of the
questions we will contemplate in this course as associated with issues
related to sex, gender, sexuality, race and class by examining love and
marriage in literature, poetry, music, and in philosophical treatises on the
subject utilizing the historical method as the primary approach.
HS-108 Human Gods: Science, Technology, and Culture in History
Credits: 3
Term Offered: Spring Term
Course Type(s): HS.SV
This is a readings-and-discussion-based history course on the interplay
between science, technology, and culture in human societies from
the scientiﬁc revolution to the human genome project. In this course,
we will explore the relationship between what science writer Richard
Rhodes has alluded to in his text The Making of the Atomic Bomb as a
"Republic of Science" and human culture, as coupled with discussion of
the connection between scientiﬁc discovery and technological advance
(an in turn how technology impacts human culture) within the context
of world history. The focal point of this course is to critically examine
how scientists are shaped by the cultures they live in and how scientists
and their discoveries impact culture. Speciﬁcally, we will contemplate
how cultural attitudes about race and gender shape scientiﬁc inquiry
such as with the emergence of race science in the age of Darwin during
the nineteenth century, and the emergence of eugenics in the early
twentieth century. The overarching theme of the course is "Human Gods"
because we will pay close attention to how scientists in their attempts
to manipulate nature in the sense "play god" and how playing god may
have devastating consequences for marginalized groups in particular and
humanity more generally. The various arenas of science and technology
including medicine, military technology, and computer technology are
examined to demonstrate how individuals, industries, and governments
have harnessed science and technology to control nature (such as with
disease control, other nations in warfare, and general human activity via
computer technologies).

Music (MU)

MU-224 Global Popular Music
Credits: 3
Term Offered: All Terms
Course Type(s): AT, GU
In the age of globalization and the Internet, popular music (music
produced for commercial purposes and transmitted through mass media
to a large audience) is an increasingly global phenomenon and can
provide a unique perspective into the social, political, and economic
conditions of various cultures around the world. This course introduces
students to some of the popular musics from around the world through
the perspective of ethnomusicology, the study of music and culture
and the ways that they intersect and influence one another. Emphasis
is placed on analyzing musical innovations, trends, and movements in
relation to location, culture, counter-culture, and the social/geo-political
climate. In doing so, this course draws upon geographical case studies
of popular music (for example, Algerian Rai, K-Pop, Bollywood, Indonesian
dangdut, or the Afrobeat of Fela Kuti) to view how historical, social,
and political factors have influenced their development. These issues
will be explored through directed reading and listening assignments,

MU-227 Introducing the Beatles!
Credits: 3
Term Offered: All Terms
Course Type(s): AT, HY
This course addresses the Beatles' musical career in terms of their wideranging cultural and artistic influence. Particular attention will be devoted
to examining their songs within the context of their composition and in
terms of their place (and placement) on the band's albums. In addition to
investigating their biographical lives, we will discuss the Beatles' overtly
literary and textual intentions, especially their various attempts at irony,
parody, and satire. This course's chronological design is arranged in
order to capture the band's artistic trajectory from two-track recording
and the relatively primitive Please Please Me album through the sonic
heights of Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The White
Album, and Abbey Road. The thrust of this course is interpretive in nature,
with the Beatles' songs and albums receiving considerable scrutiny in
terms of their composition, production, and attendant musicianship.
Developments in recording and instrument technology are germane to
our understanding of the Beatles' evolving aesthetic, as is the bandmates'
development as songwriters who eventually eschew issues associated
with romance in order to address larger and more prescient subjects
in their music such as loneliness, oppression, nostalgia, ethics, and
redemption.

newness, 2) a reﬁnement and loosely agreed upon normalcy and 3) a
stage, for lack of better description, "Istic," where nothing new is brought
about and contributors either branch out or embellish what they can't
penetrate with a new leap. Through the two main disciplines of Art and
